      subroutine balbak(nm,n,low,igh,scale,m,z)
c
      integer i,j,k,m,n,ii,nm,igh,low
      REAL*8 scale(n),z(nm,m)
      REAL*8 s
c
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure balbak,
c     num. math. 13, 293-304(1969) by parlett and reinsch.
c     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 315-326(1971).
c
c     this subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a real general
c     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
c     balanced matrix determined by  balanc.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
c          array parameters as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix.
c
c        low and igh are integers determined by  balanc.
c
c        scale contains information determining the permutations
c          and scaling factors used by  balanc.
c
c        m is the number of columns of z to be back transformed.
c
c        z contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigen-
c          vectors to be back transformed in its first m columns.
c
c     on output
c
c        z contains the real and imaginary parts of the
c          transformed eigenvectors in its first m columns.

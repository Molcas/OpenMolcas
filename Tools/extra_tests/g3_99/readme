If the file run_all is executed a file called result is produced with 
printed energies for all molecules in the g3/99 test set.

Syntax:

run_all <basis set> (default is 6-31G*) <{scf,dft or mp2}> (default is
scf) <functional> (default is B3LYP) 

For more advanced usages edit the scriptfile run_all, the generic
input-file generic.input or just write your own script using all or
some of the xyz-files in the directory.

The geometries is the same as on

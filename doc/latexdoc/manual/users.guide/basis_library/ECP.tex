\paragraph{Core AIMP's}
\label{UG:sec:core_aimps}
 
   The list of core potentials and valence basis sets
available in the \file{ECP} library follows.
Although AIMP's exist in the literature for different core
sizes, this library includes only those recommended by
the authors after numerical experimentation.
Relativistic CG-AIMP's and NP-AIMP's, respectively, and nonrelativistic NR-AIMP's are included.
Each entry of the CG-AIMP's and the NR-AIMP's in the list is accompanied with a recommended contraction pattern 
(to be used in the fifth field).
The NP-AIMP basis sets are given explicitly in the recommended contraction pattern.
For the third-row transition metals two NP-AIMP basis sets are provided which differ
in the number of primitive and contracted f GTFs. For further details, please refer to
the literature.\cite{Rakowitz:99b}
For more information about a particular entry consult the \file{ECP} library.

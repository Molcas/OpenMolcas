This file describes the contents of this distribution of REVTeX 4.2,
version 4.2c. The definitive source of information about REVTeX 4
is the APS web page http://journals.aps.org/revtex/.

User queries should be directed to revtex@aps.org.

Manifest
--------
All files in this release are contained within a second zip file within the
main zip file called revtex4-2-tds.zip. This contains all of the REVTeX 4.2
files in the TeX Directory Structure (TDS) layout used with most current TeX
distributions. Install REVTeX 4.2 by unzipping the files in the appropriate
place (usually the texmf-local directory of your local TeX installation) and
running texhash or the equivalent command to index the files. Please consult your
TeX distribution's guide for installing new packages.

NOTE: The only files necessary for running REVTeX 4.2 are those under 
tex/latex/revtex and bibtex/bst/revtex, but it is a good idea to install
the entire distribution, especially the documentation.

Not Included   
------------
The following packages are required by REVTeX but are not
included in this distribution. Please obtain from CTAN
(Comprehensive TeX Archive Network), e.g. <http://www.ctan.org/>. Direct
links to the necessary files can be found at <http://journals.aps.org/revtex/>.

natbib.dtx   - Version 8.31a or later; found in latex/contrib/natbib on CTAN
natbib.ins   - LaTeX this to create natbib.sty and natbib
               documentation from natbib.dtx
bm.dtx       - Bold math style - part of (current!) standard LaTeX2e tools
bm.sty       - generated from bm.dtx by running tools.ins
textcase.dtx - Found in latex/contrib/textcase on CTAN
textcase.ins - LaTeX this to generate textcase.sty from textcase.dtx
url.sty      - Found in latex/contrib/misc on CTAN

An up-to-date installation of AMS-LaTeX is also required for certain
documentclass options. Version 2.0 or higher is needed. It is
available from <http://www.ams.org/tex/>.

Recommended styles and packages
--------------------------
With REVTeX implemented as a native LaTeX2e document class, users can 
take advantage of many of the well-supported LaTeX2e packages available.
Here are some that are particularly useful and recommended.

longtable.sty for tables running to multiple pages - part of a
standard LaTeX2e distribution.

hyperref.sty for hyperlinking - should work well with REVTeX 4.2.

graphics.sty and graphicx.sty for figure inclusion - part of LaTeX2e's
standard distribution.

Credits
-------
David Carlisle created the first draft of REVTeX 4; Arthur Ogawa has 
supported the TeX development versions 4.0 and 4.1. Patrick Daly was so kind
as to incorporate needed changes into natbib and custom-bib. All worked under 
commission from the APS, with the support of AIP, and was coordinated by Mark
Doyle, APS. Version 4.2 was initially developed by Aptara Corporation under
the guidance of Mark Doyle, APS, and Brian Goss, AIP. Development of the final
version of 4.2 was done by Mark Doyle. The APS is the maintainer of REVTeX,
and all bugs are our responsibility. Please e-mail feedback to revtex@aps.org.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------
The REVTeX 4.2 class file has been named revtex4-2.cls to distinguish it
from its predecessors. Files prepared under REVTeX 4.0 or 4.1 may need minor
changes to process under 4.2 and the output may be formatted differently.

LaTeX2e requirements
--------------------
REVTeX 4 requires: 
LaTeX2e [1996/06/01],
natbib  [2009/11/07]
textcase

:program:`VIBROT` --- A Program for Vibration--Rotation on Diatomic Molecules
=============================================================================

The program :program:`VIBROT` computes vibration-rotation spectra for diatomic
molecules. As input it uses a potential curve computed pointwise by any of
the wave function programs. It does not require other input file from any
of the |molcas| programs, just its standard input file.

In the Advances Examples the reader will find an overview of the input and
output files required by :program:`VIBROT` and the different uses of the
program on the calculation of the electronic states of the :math:`C_2` molecule.
The reader is referred to :numref:`UG:sec:vibrot`
of the user's guide for a detailed description of the program.

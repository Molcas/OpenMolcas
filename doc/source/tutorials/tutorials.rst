Program Based Tutorials
=======================

The |molcas| suite of Quantum Chemical programs is modular in
design. The desired calculation is achieved by executing a list of
|molcas| program modules in succession, while potentially manipulating
the program information files. If the information files from a previous
calculation are saved, then a subsequent calculation need not recompute
them. This is dependent on the correct information being preserved in
the information files for subsequent calculations.
Each module has keywords to specify the
functions to be carried out, and many modules rely on the
specification of keywords in previous modules.

The following sections describe the use of the |molcas| modules and
their inter-relationships. Each module is introduced in the
approximate order for performing a typical calculation.
A complete flowchart for the |molcas| suite of programs follows.

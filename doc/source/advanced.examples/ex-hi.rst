High quality wave functions at optimized structures

Here we will give an example of how geometrical structures obtained at
one level of theory can be used in an analysis at high quality wave functions.
:numref:`tab:tsgeo` compiles the obtained CASSCF geometries for
the dimethylcarbene to propene reaction (see :numref:`fig:reaction`).
They can be compared to the MP2 geometries :cite:`Ford:97`.
The overall agreement is good.

   Dimethylcarbene to propene reaction path

The wave function at each of the geometries was
proved to be almost a single configuration. The second configuration in
all the cases contributed by less than 5% to the weight of the wave
function. It is a double excited replacement. Therefore, although
MP2 is not generally expected to describe properly a bond formation
in this case its behavior seems to be validated. The larger discrepancies
appear in the carbon-carbon distances in the dimethylcarbene and in
the transition state. On one hand the basis set used in the present
example were small; on the other hand there are indications that
the MP2 method overestimates the hyper conjugation effects present
in the dimethylcarbene :cite:`Ford:97`. :numref:`fig:carbene` displays
the dimethylcarbene with indication of the employed labeling.

   single: Geometry

The main structural effects occurring during the reaction can be observed
displayed in :numref:`tab:tsgeo`. As the rearrangement starts out one
hydrogen atom (:math:`\ce{H{5}}`) moves in a plane almost perpendicular to the plane
formed by the three carbon atoms while the remaining two hydrogen atoms
on the same methyl group swing very rapidly into a nearly planar
position (see :numref:`fig:reaction`).
As the :math:`\pi` bond is formed we observe
a contraction of the :math:`\ce{C{1}-C{2}}` distance. In contrast, the spectator
methyl group behaves as a rigid body. Their parameters were
not compiled here but it rotates and bends slightly :cite:`Ford:97`. Focusing
on the second half reaction, the moving hydrogen atom rotates into the
plane of the carbon atoms to form the new :math:`\ce{C{1}-H{5}}` bond. This movement
is followed by a further shortening of the preformed :math:`\ce{C{1}-C{2}}` bond,
which acquires the bond distance of a typical double carbon bond, and
smaller adjustments in the positions of the other atoms. The structures
of the reactant, transition state, and product are shown in
:numref:`fig:reaction`.

As was already mentioned we will apply now higher-correlated methods
for the reactant, product, and transition state system at the CASSCF
optimized geometries to account for more accurate relative energies.
In any case a small basis set has been used and therefore the goal is
not to be extremely accurate. For more complete results see Ref.
:cite:`Ford:97`. We are going to perform calculations with the
MP2, MRCI, ACPF, CASPT2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) methods.

Starting with dimethylcarbene, we will use the following input file:

Observe in the previous input that we have generated a multiconfigurational
wave function for CASPT2, MRCI, and ACPF wave functions but a single configuration
reference wave function (using :program:`RASSCF` program with the options
:kword:`OUTOrbitals` and :kword:`CANOnical`)
for the CCSD and CCSD(T) wave functions. Notice also
that to compute a multiconfigurational ACPF wave function we have to use
the :program:`MRCI` program, not the :program:`CPF` module which does not accept
more than one single reference. In all the highly correlated
methods we have frozen the three carbon core orbitals because of the reasons
already explained in :numref:`TUT:sec:x2`. For MRCI, ACPF, CCSD, and CCSD(T)
the freezing is performed in the :program:`MOTRA` step.

.. index::
   single: Reference space
   single: Active space

One question that can be addressed is which is the proper reference space
for the multiconfigurational calculations. As was explained when we selected
the active space for the geometry optimizations, we performed several tests
at different stages in the reaction path and observed that the smallest
meaningful active space, two electrons in two orbitals, was sufficient
in all the cases. We can come back to this problem here to select the
reference for CASPT2, MRCI, and ACPF methods. The simple analysis of the
SCF orbital energies shows that in dimethylcarbene, for instance, the
orbital energies of the :math:`\ce{C-H}` bonds are close to those of the :math:`\ce{C-C}` :math:`\sigma`
bonds and additionally those orbitals are strongly mixed along
the reaction path. A balanced active space including all orbitals necessary
to describe the shifting H-atom properly would require a full valence
space of 18 electrons in 18 orbitals. This is not a feasible space, therefore
we proceed with the minimal active space and analyze later the quality
of the results. The CASSCF wave function will then include for dimethylcarbene
and the transition state structure the :math:`(\sigma)^2(\pi)^0` and
:math:`(\sigma)^0(\pi)^2` configurations correlating the non-bonded electrons
localized at the carbenoid center where as for propene the active space
include the equivalent valence :math:`\pi` space.

   single: Option; Symmetry in GUGA

The :program:`GUGA` input must be built carefully. There are several
ways to specify the reference configurations for the following methods.
First, the keyword :kword:`ELECtrons` refers to the total number of
electrons that are going to be correlated, that is, all except those
frozen in the previous :program:`MOTRA` step.
Keywords :kword:`INACtive` and
:kword:`ACTIve` are optional and describe the number of inactive
(occupation two in all the reference configurations) and active
(varying occupation number in the reference configurations) orbitals
of the space. Here :kword:`ACTIve` indicates one orbital of each
of the symmetries. The following keyword :kword:`CIALl` indicates
that the reference space will be the full CI within the subspace
of active orbitals. It must be always followed by symmetry index
(number of the irrep) for the resulting wave function, one here.

For the transition state structure we do not impose any symmetry
restriction, therefore the calculations are performed in the :math:`C_1` group
with the input file:

We can discuss now the quality of the results obtained and their
reliability (for a more careful discussion of the accuracy of
quantum chemical calculations see Ref. :cite:`Taylor:92b`).
In first place we have to consider that a valence
double-zeta plus polarization basis set is somewhat small to obtain
accurate results. At least a triple-zeta quality would be required.
The present results have, however, the goal to serve as an example.
We already pointed out that the CASSCF geometries were very similar
to the MP2 reported geometries :cite:`Ford:97`. This fact validates
both methods. MP2 provides remarkably accurate geometries using
basis sets of triple-zeta quality, as in Ref. :cite:`Ford:97`, in
situations were the systems can be described as singly configurational,
as the CASSCF calculations show. The Hartree--Fock configuration has
a contribution of more than 95% in all three structures, while the
largest weight for another configuration appears in propene for
:math:`(\pi)^0(\pi^*)^2` (4.2%).

The Hartree--Fock configuration contributes to the
MRCI configuration with a weight of 85.4%, while the next configuration
contributes by 2.8%. Similar conclusions can be obtained analyzing the
ACPF results and for the other structures. We will keep the MRCI results
including the Davidson correction (MRCI+Q) which corrects for the
size-inconsistency of the truncated CI expansion :cite:`Taylor:92b`.

The weight of the CASSCF reference to the first-order wave function is
here 87.9%, very close to the weights obtained for the dimethylcarbene and
the transition state structure,
and there is only a small contribution to the wave function and energy
which is larger than the selected thresholds. This should not be considered as a
intruder state, but as a contribution from the fourth inactive orbital which
could be, eventually, included in the active space. The contribution to the
second-order energy in this case is smaller than 1 kcal/mol. It can be observed
that the same contribution shows up for the transition state structure but not
for the dimethylcarbene. In principle this could be an indication that a larger
active space, that is, four electrons in four orbitals, would give a slightly
more accurate CASPT2 energy. The present results will probably overestimate
the second-order energies for the transition state structure and the propene,
leading to a slightly smaller activation barrier and a slightly larger
exothermicity, as can be observed in :numref:`tab:rpener`. The orbitals
pointed out as responsible for the large contributions in propene are the
fourth inactive and 22nd secondary orbitals of the first symmetry. They are
too deep and too high, respectively, to expect that an increase in the active
space could in fact represent a great improvement in the CASPT2 result.
In any case we tested for four orbitals-four electrons CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations
and the results were very similar to those presented here.

Finally we can analyze the so-called :math:`\tau_1`\-diagnostic :cite:`Lee:89`
for the coupled-cluster wave functions. :math:`\tau_1` is defined for closed-shell
coupled-cluster methods as the Euclidean norm of the vector of :math:`T_1`
amplitudes normalized by the number of electrons correlated:
:math:`\tau_1 = \lVert T_1\Vert/N_{\text{el}}^{1/2}`.

In this case T1aa and T1bb are identical because we are computing a
closed-shell singlet state. The five largest :math:`T_1` amplitudes are
printed, as well as the Euclidean norm. Here the number of correlated
electrons is 18, therefore the value for the :math:`\tau_1` diagnostic is 0.01.
This value can be considered acceptable as evaluation of the
quality of the calculation. The use of :math:`\tau_1` as a diagnostic is
based on an observed empirical correlation: larger values give poor
CCSD results for molecular structures, binding energies, and
vibrational frequencies :cite:`Lee:92`. It was considered that values
larger than 0.02 indicated that results from single-reference electron
correlation methods limited to single and double excitations should be
viewed with caution.

There are several considerations concerning the :math:`\tau_1` diagnostic
:cite:`Lee:89`. First, it is only valid within the frozen core
approximation and it was defined for coupled-cluster procedures
using SCF molecular orbitals in the reference function. Second, it is
a measure of the importance of non-dynamical electron correlation effects
and not of the degree of the multireference effects. Sometimes the two
effects are related, but not always (see discussion in Ref. :cite:`Lee:92`).
Finally, the performance of the CCSD(T) method is reasonably good even
in situations where :math:`\tau_1` has a value as large as 0.08.
In conclusion, the use of :math:`\tau_1` together with other wave function
analysis, such as explicitly examining the largest :math:`T_1` and :math:`T_2`
amplitudes, is the best approach to evaluate the quality of the
calculations but this must be done with extreme caution.

As the present systems are reasonably well described by a single
determinant reference function there is no doubt that the CCSD(T)
method provides the most accurate results. Here CASPT2, MRCI+Q,
ACPF, and CCSD(T) predict the barrier height from the reactant
to the transition state with an accuracy better than 1 kcal/mol.
The correspondence is somewhat worse, about 3 kcal/mol, for the
exothermicity. As the difference is largest for the CCSD(T) method
we may conclude than triple and higher order excitations are of
importance to achieve a balanced correlation treatment, in particular
with respect to the partially occupied :math:`\pi^*` orbital at the
carbenoid center. It is also noticeable that the relative MP2
energies appear to be shifted about 3--4 kcal/mol towards lower
values. This effect may be due to the overestimation of the
hyper-conjugation effect which appears to be strongest in dimethylcarbene
:cite:`Matzinger:95,Ford:97`.

.. index::
   single: Zero Point correction

Additional factors affecting the accuracy of the results obtained
are the zero point vibrational energy correction and, of course,
the saturation of the one particle basis sets. The zero point
vibrational correction could be computed by performing a numerical
harmonic vibrational analysis at the CASSCF level using |molcas|
At the MP2 level :cite:`Ford:97` the
obtained values were |-|\1.1 kcal/mol and 2.4 kcal/mol for the
activation barrier height and exothermicity, respectively.
Therefore, if we take as our best values the CCSD(T) results
of 10.4 and |-|\65.2 kcal/mol, respectively, our prediction would
be an activation barrier height of 9.3 kcal/mol and an
exothermicity of |-|\62.8 kcal/mol. Calculations with larger
basis sets and MP2 geometries gave 7.4 and |-|\66.2 kcal/mol,
respectively :cite:`Ford:97`. The experimental estimation
gives a lower limit to the activation barrier of 3.3 kcal/mol
:cite:`Ford:97`.

|molcas| provides also a number of one-electron properties
which can be useful to analyze the chemical behavior of the systems.
For instance, the Mulliken population analysis is available for the
RHF, CASSCF, CASPT2, MRCI, and ACPF wave functions. Mulliken charges
are known to be strongly biased by the choice of the basis sets,
nevertheless one can restrict the analysis to the relative charge
differences during the course of the reaction to obtain a qualitative
picture. We can use, for instance, the charge distribution obtained
for the MRCI wave function, which is listed in :numref:`tab:Mq`.
Take into account that the absolute values of the charges can
vary with the change of basis set.

In dimethylcarbene both the medium and terminal carbons appear equally charged.

carbon, :math:`\ce{C{2}}`, to the carbenoid center. For the second half of the reaction
the charge flows back to the terminal carbon from the centered carbon, probably
due to the effect of the :math:`\pi` delocalization.

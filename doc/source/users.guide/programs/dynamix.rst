            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The DYNAMIX program allows to do molecular dynamics simulations using
            the velocity Verlet algorithm. It has also the capability to detect
            non-adiabatic transition using a surface hopping algorithm.
            </HELP>

The :program:`DYNAMIX` program performs molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in |molcas|. Here the nuclei are moved according to the
classical Newton's equations which are solved numerically using the
velocity Verlet algorithm :cite:`swope:637`. The algorithm requires
coordinates, velocities and forces as input. :program:`DYNAMIX` can be
used with any electronic structure method in |molcas|. Also environmental
effects can be taken into account in the MD simulation: the solvent can be
considered implicitly using the reaction field keyword in :program:`GATEWAY`
or explicitly in hybrid QM/MM calculation which requires the :program:`ESPF`
program.

When multiple electronic states are involved in a MD simulation, a trajectory
surface hopping (TSH) algorithm allows non-adiabatic transitions between
different states. This TSH algorithm evaluates the change of the wavefunction
along the trajectory and induces a hop if certain criteria a met (for further
details read the :program:`RASSI` section). In the current implementation the
surface hopping algorithm can be used only with state averaged CASSCF
wavefunction. However, an extension for CASPT2 and other methods are in preparation.

The Tully algorithm is available in a separate module :program:`Surfacehop`.

Dependencies
------------

The coordinates and the forces are required by the :program:`DYNAMIX` program.
:program:`DYNAMIX` reads the initial coordinates from the :file:`RUNFILE` and
updates them in each iteration. In addition :program:`DYNAMIX` depends on the
:program:`ALASKA` program, since it generates forces.

Input
-----

This section describes the input syntax of :program:`DYNAMIX` in the |molcas| program
package. In general a MD simulation requires a :kword:`FOREACH` loop which contains
several programs to compute the energy and :program:`ALASKA` for subsequent gradient
computation. The input of the :program:`DYNAMIX` begins with the program name,
and is followed by the only compulsory keyword :kword:`VELV` which specifies the
velocity Verlet algorithm: ::

Input examples
..............

The following example shows the input for an excited state CASSCF molecular dynamics
simulation of a methaniminium cation using the :program:`DYNAMIX` program. The FOREACH loop
allows 1000 steps with 10 a.u. of time step size which leads to a total duration of
242 fs. In the :program:`RASSCF` program the second root is selected for gradient
calculation using the keyword :kword:`MDRLXR`. This input assumes that the a
:file:`JOBIPH` file with orbitals is already given. In each iteration the :file:`JOBIPH`
is updated to achieve a fast convergence of the CASSCF wavefunction.
A Nosé--Hoover chain of thermostats, enabled with THERmo= 2, is used to
reproduce dynamics at constant temperature, where the initial velocities are
taken from a Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution at 300 K.

Dynamixtools
------------

This tool can be found into the :file:`Tools/` folder and it will provide some general tools to manage molecular dynamics calculations. At the moment it can be used to generate intial conditions (geometries and momenta) following a Boltzmann distribution, based on a frequency calculation. It is working with a :file:`freq.molden` file (:file:`.h5` support coming soon...).

From the command prompt: ::

  $ python3 dynamixtools.py -h
  usage: dynamixtools.py [-h] [-s SEED] [-l LABEL] -i I [-b BOL] -t TEMP

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -s SEED, --seed SEED  indicate the SEED to use for the generation of randoms
    -l LABEL, --label LABEL
                          label for your project (default is "geom")
    -i I, --input I       path of the frequency h5 or molden file
    -b BOL, --boltzmann BOL
                          number of initial condition following Boltzmann
                          distribution (default 1)
    -t TEMP, --temperature TEMP
                          temperature in kelvin for the initial conditions

Having a :file:`water.freq.molden` file, this is the command to generate 200 initial conditions using 3435432 as seed and a temperature of 300 kelvin: ::

  $ python3 dynamixtools.py -i water.freq.molden -t 300 -b 200 -s 3435432

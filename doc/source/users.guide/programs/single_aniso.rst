The :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` program is a routine which allows the non-perturbative calculation of effective spin (pseudospin) Hamiltonians and static magnetic properties of mononuclear complexes and fragments completely *ab initio*, including the spin-orbit interaction. As a starting point it uses the results of :program:`RASSI` calculation for the ground and several excited spin-orbital multiplets. A short description of methodology and applications can be found in :cite:`Chibotaru:1`, :cite:`Chibotaru:2`. The second version of the :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` program is able to calculate the following quantities:

* Parameters of pseudospin magnetic Hamiltonians (the methodology is described in :cite:`Chibotaru:3`):

  #. First rank (linear after pseudospin) Zeeman splitting tensor :math:`g_{\alpha\beta}`, its main values, including the sign of the product :math:`g_{X} \cdot g_{Y} \cdot g_{Z}`, and the main magnetic axes.
  #. Second rank (bilinear after pseudospin) zero-field splitting tensor :math:`D_{\alpha\beta}`, its main values and the anisotropy axes. The anisotropy axes are given in two coordinate systems: a) in the initial Cartesian coordinate system (:math:`x, y, z`) and b) in the coordinate system of the main magnetic axes (:math:`X_{\text{m}}, Y_{\text{m}}, Z_{\text{m}}`).
  #. Higher rank ZFS tensors (:math:`D^4`, :math:`D^6`, etc.) and Zeeman splitting tensors (:math:`G^3`, :math:`G^5`, etc.) for complexes with moderate and strong spin-orbit coupling.
  #. Angular moments along the main magnetic axes.

* All (27) parameters of the *ab initio* Crystal field acting on the ground atomic multiplet of lanthanides, and the decomposition of the CASSCF/RASSI wave functions into functions with definite projections of the total angular moment on the quantization axis.

* Static magnetic properties:

  #. Van Vleck susceptibility tensor :math:`\chi_{\alpha\beta}(T)`.
  #. Powder magnetic susceptibility function :math:`\chi(T)`.
  #. Magnetization vector :math:`\vec M (\vec H)` for specified directions of the applied magnetic field :math:`\vec H`.
  #. Powder magnetization :math:`M_{\text{mol}}(H)`.

The magnetic Hamiltonians are defined for a desired group of :math:`N` electronic states obtained in :program:`RASSI` calculation to which a pseudospin :math:`\tilde{S}` (it reduces to a true spin :math:`S` in the absence of spin-orbit coupling) is subscribed according to the relation :math:`N=2\tilde{S}+1`. For instance, the two wave functions of a Kramers doublet correspond to :math:`\tilde{S}=1/2`. The implementation is done for :math:`\tilde{S}=1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots ,15/2`.

.. The second version of the :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` program allows the calculation of all 27 parameters of the exact Crystal-Field acting on the ground atomic multiplet for lanthanides. Moreover, the *ab initio* wave functions corresponding to the lowest atomic multiplet :math:`\ket{J,M_J}` are decomposed in a linear combination of functions with definite projection of the total moment on the quantization axis.

The calculation of magnetic properties takes into account the contribution of excited states (the ligand-field and charge transfer states of the complex or mononuclear fragment included in the RASSI calculation) via their thermal population and Zeeman admixture. The intermolecular exchange interaction between magnetic molecules in a crystal can be taken into account during the simulation of magnetic properties by a phenomenological parameter :math:`z_J` specified by the user (see keyword :kword:`MLTP`).

Dependencies
------------

The :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` program takes all needed *ab initio* information from the :file:`RUNFILE`: i.e. matrix elements of angular momentum, spin-orbit energy spectrum and mixing coefficients, number of mixed states and their multiplicity, etc. In order to find the necessary information in the :file:`RUNFILE`, the keywords MEES and SPIN are mandatory for :program:`RASSI`. The :program:`SEWARD` keyword ANGM is also compulsory.

:file:`RUNFILE`
  The file of communication between different modules in |molcas|. Normally it is already present in :file:`i$WorkDir`.
  The :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` may be restarted as many times as necessary in the same working directory where the previous :program:`RASSI` was succesfully executed. The :file:`RUNFILE` contains then all necessary data.

:file:`ANISOINPUT`
  The program may be restarted from the ASCII text file :file:`ANISOINPUT` generated by a previous succesful run of the :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` (the name of this file may be specified during execution, see :kword:`REST` keyword below). This file contains all necessary data for :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` as well as for the :program:`POLY_ANISO`. In this case the initial :file:`$WorkDir` may be empty (:file:`RUNFILE` is not necessary).

:file:`$Project.aniso`
  The :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` may be restarted from the binary file :file:`$Project.aniso` produced in a previous run. The initial :file:`$WorkDir` may be empty (:file:`RUNFILE` is not necessary).

.. class:: filelist

:file:`$Project.aniso`
  This binary file may be used for restart. It is produced by any successful run of the code.

:file:`ANISOINPUT`
  This file is intended to be as input for the :program:`POLY_ANISO` module in |molcas|. It is an ASCII formated file. It is produced by any successful run of the code.

:file:`zeeman_energy_xxx.txt`
  Zeeman eignestates for the applied field in the direction # *xxx* are placed in the corresponding text file. It may be used directly with external plotting programs like gnuplot to visualize the data.

:file:`XT_compare.txt`
  In case :kword:`TEXP` is employed (experimental XT(T) data points), the :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` produces a data file used to directly plot the comparison between experimental and calculated magnetic susceptibility.

:file:`MH_compare_xxx.txt`
  In case :kword:`HEXP` is employed (experimental M(H,T) data points), the :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` produces one or several data file(s) used to directly plot the comparison(s) between experimental and calculated molar magnetization at each temperature.

Input
-----

Normally :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` runs without specifying any of the following keywords. The only unknown variable for :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` is the dimension (multiplicity) of the pseudospin. By default one multiplet is selected, which has the dimension equal to the multiplicity of the ground term. For example, in cases where spin-orbit coupling is weak, the multiplicity of the effective spin Hamiltonian is usually the same as the multiplicity of the lowest term, while in the cases with strong anisotropy (lanthanide or actinide complexes, :math:`\ce{Co^{2+}}` complexes, etc...) the lowest energy levels of the complexes form a group of states which can differ quite strong from the spin multiplicity of the lowest term. In these cases the user should specify the multiplicity corresponding to a chosen value of pseudospin :math:`(2\tilde{S}+1)`. For instance, in :math:`\ce{Dy^{3+}}` the spin of the ground state term is :math:`S=5/2`, but in many situations only the ground Kramers doublet is considered; then the user should set the multiplicity of the pseudospin equal to 2 (see :kword:`MLTP` keyword).
The calculation of the parameters of the crystal field corresponding to the ground atomic multiplet for lanthanides should be requested by the CRYS keyword. ::

  second-order perturbation theory. The program will read two integer

  The field-dependent magnetization is calculated at the temperature value TMAG.
  Example: ::

  This means that the magnetization coming from all spin-orbit states with energy lower

  is larger than the total number of spin-orbit states(:math:`N_{\text{SS}}`, then the :math:`N_{\text{CUT}}` is set to :math:`N_{\text{SS}}`

:kword:`CRYS`
  This keyword will enables the computation of the parameters of the crystal-field acting on the ground atomic multiplet of a
  lanthanide from the *ab initio* calculation performed. The implemented methodology is described :cite:`Ungur2017` and :cite:`Chibotaru:3`.
  Two types of crystal field parametererization are implemented:

  1. Parameterisation of the ground :math:`\ket{J,M_J}` group of spin-orbit states (e.g. parameterisation of the ground :math:`J=15/2` of a :math:`\ce{Dy^{3+}}` complex).
  2. Parameterisation of the ground :math:`\ket{L,M_L}` group of spin-free states (e.g. parameterisation of the ground :math:`^6H` multiplet of a :math:`\ce{Dy^{3+}}`).

  For each of the above cases, the parameters of the crystal field are given in terms of irreducible tensor
  operators defined in :cite:`Chibotaru:3`, in terms of Extended Stevens Operators defined in :cite:`Rudowicz1985,Rudowicz2004,Rudowicz2015` and also
  employed in the EasySpin function of MATLAB.
  On the next line the program will read the chemical symbol of the metal ion.
  The code understands the labels of: lanthanides, actinides and first-row transition metal ions. For transition metal ions, the oxidation state
  should be indicated as well.
  By default the program will not compute the parameters of the crystal-field.

:kword:`UBAR`
  This keyword allows estimation of the structuere of the blocking barier of a single-molecule magnet. The default is not to compute it.

  .. figure:: ubar.*
     :name: fig:ubar
     :width: 75%
     :align: center

     Pictorial representation of the low-lying energy structure of a single-molecule magnet. A qualitative performance picture of the investigated single-molecular magnet is estimated by the strengths of the transition matrix elements of the magnetic moment connecting states with opposite magnetizations (:math:`n{+} \to n{-}`). The height of the barrier is qualitatively estimated by the energy at which the matrix element (:math:`n{+} \to n{-}`) is large enough to induce significant tunnelling splitting at usual magnetic fields (internal) present in the magnetic crystals (0.01 -- 0.1 tesla). For the above example, the blocking barrier closes at the state (:math:`8{+} \to 8{-}`).

  All transition matrix elements of the magnetic moment are given as
  (:math:`(\vert\mu_{X}\vert+\vert\mu_{Y}\vert+\vert\mu_{Z}\vert)/3`).
  The data is given in Bohr magnetons (:math:`\mu_{\text{Bohr}}`).
  The keyword is used with no arguments.

            <HELP>
            The Seward module generates one- and two-electron integrals needed
            by other programs. The input contains an additional and optional
            embedded input section for numerical quadrature options for the
            computation of integrals associated with DFT calculations. The
            embedded section starts and ends with the keywords "Grid Input"
            and "End of Grid", respectively. Keywords associated with this
            embedded input section is labelled "(NQ)" below.
            </HELP>

The :program:`SEWARD` module generates one- and two-electron integrals needed
by other programs. The two-electron integrals may optionally be
Cholesky decomposed. In addition, it will serve as the input parser
for parameters related to the specification of the quadrature grid
used in numerical integration in association with DFT and reaction
field calculations.

      H. W. Seward, secretary of State in the Lincoln administration, who suggested and supervised
      the 1867 purchase of Alaska from tzar Russia. Price: 2 cents an acre.

In the following three subsection we will in detail describe the input parameters
for analytic integration, numerical integration, and reaction fields.

Analytic integration
--------------------

Any conventional ab initio quantum chemical calculation starts by
computing overlap, kinetic energy, nuclear attraction and electron
repulsion integrals. These are used repeatedly to determine the
optimal wave function and the total energy of the system under
investigation. Finally, to compute various properties of the system
additional integrals may be needed, examples include multipole moments
and field gradients.

.. _UG\:sec\:seward_description:

Description
...........

:program:`SEWARD` is able to compute the following integrals:

* kinetic energy,

* nuclear attraction,

* two electron repulsion (optionally Cholesky decomposed),

* :math:`n`\th (default :math:`n`\=2) order moments (overlap, dipole moment, etc.),

* electric field (generated at a given point by all charges in the system),

* electric field gradients (spherical gradient operators),

* linear momentum (velocity),

* orbital angular momentum,

* relativistic mass-velocity correction (1st order),

* one-electron Darwin contact term,

* one-electron relativistic no-pair Douglas--Kroll,

* diamagnetic shielding,

* spherical well potential (Pauli repulsion),

* ECP and PP integrals,

* modified kinetic energy and multipole moment integrals
  (integration on a finite sphere centered at the origin) for use in
  the variational :math:`R`\-matrix approach,

* external field (represented by a large number of charges and dipoles),

* angular momentum products, and

* atomic mean-field integrals (AMFI) for spin--orbit coupling.

*Note that while* :program:`SEWARD` *compute these integrals the input to
select them and their settings are put in the input of* :program:`GATEWAY`.

In general these integrals will be written to a file, possibly in
the form of Cholesky vectors (two-electron integrals only). However,
:program:`SEWARD` can also compute the orbital contributions and total components of
these properties if provided with orbital coefficients and
orbital occupation numbers.

To generate the one- and two-electron integrals
:program:`SEWARD` uses two different integration schemes. Repulsion type integrals (two-electron
integrals, electric field integrals, etc.) are evaluated by
the reduced multiplication scheme of the Rys quadrature :cite:`seward`.
All other integrals are computed by the Gauss--Hermite quadrature.
:program:`SEWARD` use spherical Gaussians as basis functions,
the only exception to this are the diffuse/polarization functions
of the 6-31G family of basis sets.
The double coset :cite:`dcf` formalism is used to treat symmetry.
:program:`SEWARD` is especially designed to handle ANO-type basis sets, however, segmented basis
sets are also processed.

At present the following limitations are built into :program:`SEWARD`:

.. _UG\:sec\:seward_dependencies:

Dependencies
............

:program:`SEWARD` usually runs after program :program:`GATEWAY`. In the same time, any input used
in :program:`GATEWAY` can be placed into :program:`SEWARD` input. However, it is recommended to
specify all information about the molecule and the basis set in :program:`GATEWAY` input.

:program:`SEWARD` does normally not depend on any other code, except of :program:`GATEWAY`.
There are two exceptions however.
The first one is when :program:`SEWARD` is used as a property module. In these cases the file
:file:`INPORB` has to have been generated by a wave function code. The second case, which is
totally transparent to the user, is when :program:`SEWARD` picks up the new Cartesian coordinates
generated by :program:`SLAPAF` during a geometry optimization.

.. _UG\:sec\:seward_files:

Files
.....

Input Files
:::::::::::

Apart form the standard input file
:program:`SEWARD` will use the following input files: :file:`RYSRW`, :file:`ABDATA`,
:file:`RUNFILE`, :file:`INPORB` (for calculation of properties) (:ref:`UG:sec:files_list`).
In addition, :program:`SEWARD` uses the following files:

.. class:: filelist

:file:`BASLIB`
  The default directory for one-particle basis set information.
  This directory contains files which are part
  of the program system and could
  be manipulated by the user in accordance with the instructions in the
  section :ref:`UG:sec:the_basis_set_libraries` and following subsections.
  New basis set files can be added to this directory by the local
  |molcas| administrator.

:file:`QRPLIB`
  Library for numerical mass-velocity plus Darwin potentials (used for ECPs).

Output files
::::::::::::

In addition to the standard output file
:program:`SEWARD` may generate the following files:
:file:`ONEINT`, :file:`ORDINT`, :file:`CHVEC`, :file:`CHRED`, :file:`CHORST`,
:file:`CHOMAP`, :file:`CHOR2F` (:ref:`UG:sec:files_list`).

.. _UG\:sec\:seward_input:

Input
.....

Below follows a description of the input to :program:`SEWARD`.
Observe that if
nothing else is requested
:program:`SEWARD` will by default compute the overlap, the
dipole, the quadrupole, the nuclear attraction, the kinetic energy,
the one-electron Hamiltonian, and the two-electron repulsion
integrals.

The input for each module is preceded by its name like: ::

  &SEWARD

Argument(s) to a keyword, either individual or composed by several entries,
can be placed in a separated line or in the same line separated by a semicolon.
If in the same line, the first argument requires an equal sign after the
name of the keyword.

:kword:`RELAtivistic`
  Request arbitrary scalar relativistic Douglas--Kroll--Hess (DKH) correction to the one-electron Hamiltonian
  and the so-called picture-change correction to the property integrals (multipole moments
  and electronic potential related properties). An argument of the form ``RXXPyy`` follows.
  Here XX represents the order of the DKH correction to the one-electron Hamiltonian and
  yy the order of the picture-change correction. The character P denotes the parameterization
  used in the DKH procedure.
  The possible parametrizations P of the unitary transformation used
  in the DKH transformation supported by |molcas| are:

  .. container:: list

    ``P=O``: Optimum parametrization (OPT)

  Hence, the proper keyword for the 4th order relativistically corrected one-electron

The basis set label and the all electron basis set library
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. compound::

  The label, which defines the basis set for a given atom or set of atoms,
  is given as input after the
  keyword :kword:`Basis set`. It has the following general
  structure (notice that the last
  character is a period): ::

    atom.type.author.primitive.contracted.aux.

  where the different identifiers have the following meaning:

.. class:: whatnotlist

``atom``
  Specification of the atom by its chemical symbol.

``type``
  Gives the type of basis set (ANO, STO, ECP, etc.) according to
  specifications given in the basis set library, *vide supra*.
  Observe that the upper cased character of the type label
  defines the file name in the basis directory.

``author``
  First author in the publication where that basis set appeared.

``primitive``
  Specification of the primitive set (e.g. 14s9p4d3f).

``contracted``
  Specification of the contracted set to be selected. Some basis
  sets allow only one type of contraction, others all types up
  to a maximum. The first basis functions for each angular
  momentum is then used.
  **Note**, for the basis set types ANO and ECP, on-the-fly decontraction of the most
  diffuse functions are performed in case the number of contracted functions specified in this field
  exceeds what formally is specified in the library file.

``aux``
  Specification of the type of AIMP, for instance, to choose between
  non-relativistic and relativistic core AIMP's.

Only the identifiers ``atom``, ``type``,
and ``contracted`` have to be included in
the label. The others can be left out. However, the periods have to be
kept. Example --- the basis set label
"``C.ano-s...4s3p2d.``"
will by |molcas| be
interpreted as
"``C.ano-s.Pierloot.10s6p3d.4s3p2d.``",
which is the first
basis set in the ANO-S file in the
basis directory that fulfills the specifications given.

More information about basis set format can be found in
the section Advanced examples.

.. _UG\:sec\:dft:

Numerical integration
---------------------

Various Density Functional Theory (DFT) models can be used in |molcas|.
Energies and analytical gradients are available for all DFT models.
In DFT the exact exchange present in HF theory is replaced by a more general
expression, the exchange-correlation functional, which accounts for both the exchange energy, :math:`E_{\text{X}} [P]`
and the electron correlation energy, :math:`E_{\text{C}} [P]`.

.. _UG\:sec\:df_description:

Description
...........

We shall now describe briefly how the exchange and correlation energy terms look like.
The functionals used in DFT are integrals of some function of the electron density and optionally the gradient
of the electron density

.. math:: E_{\text{X}}[P] = \int f(\rho_{\alpha}(r), \rho_{\beta}(r), \nabla \rho_{\alpha}(r), \nabla \rho_{\beta}(r))\;dr

The various DFT methods differ in which function, :math:`f`, is used for :math:`E_{\text{X}}[P]` and for :math:`E_{\text{C}}[P]`.
In |molcas| pure DFT methods are supported, together with hybrid methods, in which the exchange functional
is a linear combination of the HF exchange and a functional integral of the above form.
The latter are evaluated by numerical quadrature.
In the :program:`SEWARD` input the parameters for the numerical integration can be set up.
In the :program:`SCF` and :program:`RASSCF` inputs the keywords for
using different functionals can be specified.
Names for the various pure DFT models are given by combining the names for the exchange and correlation functionals.

The DFT gradients has been implemented for both the fixed and the moving grid approach :cite:`Johnson:93,Handy:93,Baker:94`.
The latter is known to be translationally invariant by definition and is recommended in geometry optimizations.

Relativistic operators
----------------------

The current different implementation of all relativistic operators in |molcas| as
described in the following sections has been programmed and tested in
Ref. :cite:`R2C_review`

Using the Douglas--Kroll--Hess Hamiltonian
..........................................

For all-electron calculations, the preferred way is to use the scalar-relativistic
Douglas--Kroll--Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian, which, in principle, is available up to arbitrary
order in Molcas; for actual calculations, however,
the standard 2nd order is usually fine, but one may use a higher order than 8th order
by default to be on the safe side.

.. compound::

  The arbitrary-order Hamiltonian is activated by setting ::

    RXXPyy

  somewhere in the :program:`SEWARD` input, where
  the ``XX`` denotes the order of the DKH Hamiltonian in the external potential.
  I.e., for the standard 2nd-order Hamiltonian you may use ``R02O``.
  Note
  in particular that the parametrization ``P`` does not affect the Hamiltonian up to
  fourth order. Therefore, as long as you run calculations with DKH Hamiltonians below
  5th order you may use any symbol for the parametrization as they would all yield the
  same results.

The possible parametrizations ``P`` of the unitary transformation used
in the DKH transformation supported by |molcas| are:

.. container:: list

  ``P=O``: Optimum parametrization (OPT)

  ``P=E``: Exponential parametrization (EXP)

  ``P=S``: Square-root parametrization (SQR)

  ``P=M``: McWeeny parametrization (MCW)

  ``P=C``: Cayley parametrization (CAY)

Up to fourth order (``XX``\=04) the DKH Hamiltonian is independent of the chosen
parametrization.
Higher-order DKH Hamiltonians depend slightly on the chosen parametrization of the unitary
transformations applied in order to decouple the Dirac Hamiltonian.
Since the EXP parameterization employs a fast algorithm :cite:`DKH_polynomial`, it is recommended
for high-order DKH transformation.

For details on the arbitrary-order DKH Hamiltonians see :cite:`DKH_Theory` with respect to theory,
:cite:`DKH_Implementation` with respect to aspects of implementation, and
:cite:`DKH_Principles` with respect to general principles of DKH.
The current version of |molcas| employs different algorithms,
but the polynomial cost scheme of the DKH implementation as described in :cite:`DKH_polynomial` is
used as the default algorithm. The implementation in MOLCAS has been presented in :cite:`R2C_review`.

For details on the different parametrizations of the unitary transformations see :cite:`DKH_Parameterization`.

Douglas--Kroll--Hess transformed properties
...........................................

As mentioned above, four-component molecular property operators need to be DKH
transformed as well when going from a four-component to a two- or one-component description;
the results do not coincide with the well-known corresponding nonrelativistic expressions
for a given property but are properly picture change corrected.

.. compound::

  The transformation of electric-field-like molecular property operators can be carried
  out for any order smaller or equal to the order chosen for the scalar-relativistic DKH Hamiltonian.
  In order to change the default transformation of order 2, you may concatenate the
  input for the DKH Hamiltonian by 2 more numbers specifying the order in the property, ::

    RxxPyy

  where ``yy`` denotes the order of the Hamiltonian starting with first order 01.
  The DKH transformation is then done automatically for all one-electron electric-field-like
  one-electron property matrices.

Also note that the current implementation of both the Hamiltonian and the property
operators is carried out in the full, completely decontracted basis set of the
molecule under consideration. The local nature of the relativistic contributions is not
yet exploited and hence large molecules may require considerable computing time for
all higher-order DKH transformations.

For details on the arbitrary-order DKH properties see :cite:`DKH_Theory2` with respect to theory
and :cite:`DKH_Implementation2,R2C_review` with respect to implementation aspects.

Using the X2C/Barysz--Sadlej--Snijders Hamiltonian
..................................................

Exact decoupling of the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian can be achieved with infinite-order
approaches, such as the so-called X2C (exact-two-component) and BSS (Barysz--Sadlej--Snijders)
method. In Molcas, both methods are available for all-electron calculations. The
evaluation of transformation matrices employs a non-iterative scheme.

.. which is superior to the iterative scheme in convergence behavior and computational cost.

The exact decoupling Hamiltonian is activated by setting either ``RX2C`` or ``RBSS``
somewhere in the :program:`SEWARD` input, where ``RX2C`` and ``RBSS`` denote using the
scalar (one-component) X2C and BSS Hamiltonian respectively. The one-electron Hamiltonian
as well as the property integrals will be transformed according to the given exact decoupling method.
In other words, all property integrals are by default picture change corrected.

The computation time of the X2C/BSS method is almost the same as of the DKH method at 8th order,
while X2C is a little bit faster than BSS since the additional free-particle Foldy--Wouthuysen
transformation is skipped in the X2C approach :cite:`R2C_review`. For molecules including only light atoms,
the DKH method with low orders (< 8) is enough to account for the relativistic effects.

.. As for heavy
   elements containing molecules, DKH with low orders is not accurate enough while DKH with high
   orders is computational expensive, the X2C method is then recommended in this case.

The differences between different exact decoupling relativistic methods are very small compared
to errors introduced by other approximations, such as the basis set incompleteness, approximate
density functionals, etc. Therefore, any exact decoupling model is acceptable for the
treatment of relativistic effects in molecular calculations.

For details on the exact decoupling approaches see :cite:`R2C_review` with respect to theories and
comparison of numerical results, :cite:`X2C_kut05jcp,X2C_liu06jcp,X2C_pen07jcp` for the X2C method, and
:cite:`BSS_bar97ijqc,BSS_ked07cpl` for the BSS method.

Local approximation to relativistic decoupling
..............................................

The computational cost for relativistic transformations increases rapidly if the molecule becomes
larger. The local DLU scheme :cite:`DLU_Theory` was proposed to reduce the computational cost
based on the atomic decomposition of the (unitary) decoupling transformation. It is important to note that
the DLU scheme can be applied to any kind of relativistic approaches mentioned above (i.e., DKH, BSS, and X2C). It was found :cite:`DLU_Theory`
that the DLU approximation introduces very small errors for total energies, which are less than
0.01 milli-hartree for molecules including heavy atoms.
The local approximation is activated by setting :kword:`RLOCal` somewhere in the :program:`SEWARD` input.

The direct local approximation to the Hamiltonian, called DLH in Ref. :cite:`DLU_Theory` may be activated by setting ``RLOCal=DLH``.
However, as DLH is not superior to the DLU scheme, but introduces slightly larger errors, it is not recommended.

The picture-change effect for molecular properties is automatically taken care of when a local approximation is employed for the transformed
operator. The default order of DKH transformed properties is set to the same as the order of the DKH Hamiltonian.

It is important to note the local approximation cannot be used together with point group symmetry
in the current implementation. Because the relativistic transformation is applied in the molecular
orbital (MO) representation instead of the atomic orbital (AO) representation. Thus, the program will
report an error and exit if symmetry is used.

Description
-----------

The :program:`EMBQ` program of the |molcas| program system computes the geometrical positions and values of point charges, which reproduce the electrostatic potential in a finite volume. These point charges can be used in the embedded cluster calculations to mimic the electrostatic potential of an infinite lattice.

.. Electrostatic embedding potential
   ---------------------------------

In embedded cluster and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods, a QM description of a part of the system is combined with an empirical description of its surroundings. The QM region is said to be embedded into the potential produced by its surrounding. The :program:`EMBQ` program implements a method, which allows one to generate the electrostatic embedding potential for however complex crystalline lattice. To this end (i) a lattice unit cell is complemented with point charges which zero out all multipole moments of the unit cell up to any predefined :math:`M`-tupole and (ii) a finite nano-cluster is constructed from these redefined unit cells. As the size of this nano-cluster increases, the electrostatic potential in its inner region converges to that calculated using the Ewald's procedure.

The details of this method and examples are provided in the literature :cite:`Abarenkov:07,Sushko:10`.

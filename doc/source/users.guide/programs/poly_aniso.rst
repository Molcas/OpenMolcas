            <HELP>
            The POLY_ANISO program allows the non-perturbative calculation of
            effective spin (pseudospin) Hamiltonians and static magnetic properties
            of mononuclear complexes and fragments completely ab initio,including
            the spin-orbit interaction. As a starting point it uses the results
            of a RASSI calculation for the ground and several excited spin-orbital
            multiplets.
            The following quantities can be computed:
            ||
            ||1. Parameters of pseudospin magnetic Hamiltonians:
            ||   a) First order (linear after pseudospin) Zeeman splitting tensor (g tensor),

The :program:`POLY_ANISO` program is a routine which allows a semi-ab initio
description of the (low-lying) electronic structure and magnetic properties
of polynuclear compounds. It is based on the localized nature of the magnetic
orbitals (i.e. the |d.| or |f.| orbitals containing unpaired electrons :cite:`Anderson1959,Anderson1963`).
For many compounds of interest, the localized character of magnetic orbitals leads
to very weak character of the interactions between magnetic centers. Due to this weakness of the
interaction, the metals' orbitals and corresponding localized ground and excited states
may be optimized in the absence of the magnetic interaction at all. For this purpose, various fragmentation
models may be applied. The most commonly used fragmentation model is exemplified in :numref:`fig:fragment`.

   Fragmentation model of a polynuclear compound. The upper scheme shows a schematic overview of a tetranuclear compound and the resulting four mononuclear fragments obtained by *diamagnetic atom substitution* method. By this scheme, the neighboring magnetic centers, containing unpaired electrons are computationally replaced by their diamagnetic equivalents. As example, transition metal sites TM(II) are best replaced by either diamagnetic :math:`\ce{Zn(II)}` or :math:`\ce{Sc(III)}`, in function which one is the closest. For lanthanides :math:`\ce{Ln(III)}` the same principle is applicable, :math:`\ce{La(III)}` or :math:`\ce{Lu(III)}` are best suited to replace a given magnetic lanthanide. Individual mononuclear metal framgents are then investigated by common CASSCF/CASPT2/RASSI/SINGLE_ANISO computational method. A single file for each magnetic site, produced by the :program:`SINGLE_ANISO` run, is needed by the :program:`POLY_ANISO` code as input.

Magnetic interaction between metal sites is very important for accurate description of low-lying states and their properties.
It can be considered as a sum of various interaction mechanisms: magnetic exchange, dipole-dipole interaction, antisymmetric exchange, etc.
In the :program:`POLY_ANISO` code we have implemented several mechanisms.

The description of the magnetic exchange interaction is done within the Lines model :cite:`Lines1971`.
This model is exact in three cases:

a) interaction between two isotropic spins (Heisenberg),
b) interaction between one Ising spin (only :math:`S_z` component) and one isotropic (i.e. usual) spin, and
c) interaction between two Ising spins.

In all other cases of interaction between magnetic sites with intermediate anisotropy, the Lines model represents an
approximation. However, it was succesfully applied for a wide variety of polynuclear compounds so far.

.. compound::

  In addition to the magnetic exchange, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can be accounted exactly, by
  using the information about each metal site already computed *ab initio*. In the case of
  strongly anisotropic lanthanide compounds, the dipole-dipole interaction is usualy the dominant
  one. Dipolar magnetic coupling is one kind of long-range interaction between magnetic moments.
  For example, a system containing two magnetic dipoles :math:`\mu_1` and :math:`\mu_2`, separated by
  distance :math:`\vec{r}` have a total energy:

  .. math:: E_{\text{dip}} = \frac{\mu_{\text{Bohr}}^{2}}{r^3} [\vec{\mu}_1 \cdot \vec{\mu}_2 - 3(\vec{\mu}_1 \vec{n}_{12}) \cdot (\vec{\mu}_2 \vec{n}_{12})],

  where :math:`\vec{\mu}_{1,2}` are the magnetic moments of sites 1 and 2, respectively; :math:`r` is the distance between
  the two magnetic dipoles, :math:`\vec{n}_{12}` is the directional vector connecting the two magnetic dipoles (of unit length).
  :math:`\mu_{\text{Bohr}}^2` is the square of the Bohr magneton; with an approximative value of 0.43297 in :math:`\text{cm}^{-1}/\text{T}`.
  As inferred from the above Equation, the dipolar magnetic interaction depends on the distance and on the angle between the magnetic moments on magnetic
  centers. Therefore, the Cartesian coordinates of all non-equivalent magnetic centers must be provided in the input (see the keyword :kword:`COOR`).

Files
-----

Input files
...........

The program :program:`Poly_Aniso` needs the following files:

.. class:: filelist

:file:`aniso_XX.input`
  This is an ASCII text file generated by the |molcas|/SINGLE_ANISO program.
  It should be provided for :program:`POLY_ANISO` :file:`aniso_i.input` (:math:`i=1, 2, 3`, etc.): one file for each magnetic center.
  In cases when the entire polynuclear cluster or molecule has exact point group symmetry, only
  :file:`aniso_i.input` files for crystallographically non-equivalent centers should be given.

:file:`chitexp.input`
  set directly in the standard input (key :kword:`TEXP`)

:file:`magnexp.input`
  set directly in the standard input (key :kword:`HEXP`)

Output files
............

.. class:: filelist

:file:`zeeman_energy_xxx.txt`
  A series of files named :file:`zeeman_energy_xxx.txt` is produced in the :file:`$WorkDir` only in case keyword :kword:`ZEEM` is
  employed (see below). Each file is an ASCII text formated and contains Zeeman spectra of the investigated
  compound for each value of the applied magnetic field.

:file:`chit_compare.txt`
  A text file contining the experimental and calculated magnetic susceptibility data.

:file:`magn_compare.txt`
  A text file contining the experimental and calculated powder magnetisation data.

Files :file:`chit_compare.txt` and :file:`chit_compare.txt` may be used in connection with a simple gnuplot script
in order to plot the comparison between experimental and calculated data.

Input
-----

This section describes the keywords used to control the standard input file.
Only two keywords :kword:`NNEQ`, :kword:`PAIR` (and :kword:`SYMM` if the polynuclear cluster has symmetry) are
mandatory for a minimal execution of the program, while the other keywords allow
customization of the execution of the :program:`POLY_ANISO`.

Mandatory keywords defining the calculation
...........................................

*Keywords defining the polynuclear cluster*

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`NNEQ`
  This keyword defines several important parameters of the calculation. On the
  first line after the keyword the program reads 2 values:
  1) the number of types of different magnetic centers (NON-EQ) of the cluster and
  2) a letter ``T`` or ``F`` in the second position of the same line.
  The number of NON-EQ is the total number of magnetic centers of the cluster
  which cannot be related by point group symmetry.
  In the second position the answer to the question: *Have all NON-EQ centers been computed ab initio?*
  is given: ``T`` for *True* and ``F`` for *False*.
  On the third position, the answer to the question: *Are the rassi.h5 files to be read for input?*
  is given. For the current status, the letter ``F`` is the only option.
  On the following line the program will read NON-EQ values specifying the
  number of equivalent centers of each type.
  On the following line the program will read NON-EQ integer numbers specifying
  the number of low-lying spin-orbit functions from each center forming the local
  exchange basis.

  Some examples valid for situations where all sites have been
  computed *ab initio* (case ``T``, *True*):

  +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

  Only in cases when some centers have NOT been computed ab initio (i.e. for which no :file:`aniso_i.input` file exists),
  the program will read an additional line consisting of NON-EQ letters (``A`` or ``B``) specifying the type of each of
  the NON-EQ centers:
  ``A`` --- the center is computed ab initio and ``B`` --- the center is considered isotropic.
  On the following ``number-of-B-centers`` line(s) the isotropic :math:`g` factors of the
  center(s) defined as ``B`` are read. The spin of the ``B`` center(s) is defined: :math:`S=(N-1)/2`,
  where :math:`N` is the corresponding number of states to be taken into the exchange coupling
  for this particular center.

  Some examples valid for mixed situations: the system consists of centers computed *ab initio* and
  isotropic centers (case ``F``, *False*):

  Specifies rotation matrices to symmetry equivalent sites. This keyword is mandatory in the case more centers of a given type are present in the calculation.
  This keyword is mandatory when the calculated polynuclear compound has exact crystallographic point group symmetry. In other words, when the number of
  equivalent centers of any kind :math:`i` is larger than 1, this keyword must be employed. Here the rotation matrices from the one
  center to all the other of the same type are declared.
  On the following line the program will read the number ``1`` followed on the next lines by as many :math:`3\times3` rotation matrices as the total number of
  equivalent centers of type ``1``. Then the rotation matrices of centers of type ``2``, ``3`` and so on, follow in the same format.
  When the rotation matrices contain irrational numbers (e.g. :math:`\sin{\frac{\pi}{6}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}`), then more digits than presented in the examples
  below are advised to be given: :math:`\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=0.86602540378`.

*Keywords defining the magnetic exchange interactions*

This section defines the keywords used to set up the interacting pairs of magnetic centers
and the corresponding exchange interactions.

A few words about the numbering of the magnetic centers of the
cluster in the :program:`POLY_ANISO`. First all equivalent centers of the type 1 are
numbered, then all equivalent centers of the type 2, etc. These labels of the magnetic
centers are used further for the declaration of the magnetic coupling.
The pseudo-code is: ::

  Do i=1, number-of-non-equivalent-sites
    Do j=1, number-of-equivalent-sites-of-type(i)

*Other keywords*

Normally :program:`POLY_ANISO` runs without specifying any of the following keywords.

Argument(s) to a keyword are always supplied on the next line of the input file.

Optional general keywords to control the input
..............................................

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`MLTP`
  The number of molecular multiplets (i.e. groups of spin-orbital eigenstates) for which
  :math:`g`, :math:`D` and higher magnetic tensors will be calculated (default :kword:`MLTP`\=1).
  The program reads two lines: the first is the number of multiplets (:math:`N_{\text{MULT}}`) and the
  second the array of :math:`N_{\text{MULT}}` numbers specifying the dimension (multiplicity) of each multiplet.

  Example: ::

    MLTP
    10
    2 4 4 2 2   2 2 2 2 2

  :program:`POLY_ANISO` will compute the :math:`g` and :math:`D{-}` tensors for 10 groups of states.
  The groups 1 and 4--10 are doublets (:math:`\tilde{S}=\ket{1/2}`), while the groups 2 and 3 are quadruplets,
  having the effective spin :math:`\tilde{S}=\ket{3/2}`. For the latter cases, the ZFS (:math:`D{-}`) tensors will be computed.

              on the second line the array of NMULT numbers specifying the dimension of each multiplet.
              By default, the code will first analyze the energy spectra by itself and will
              compute the g and D tensors for ten low-lying groups of states. By using this

    This flag is used to define the cut-off energy for the lowest states for which Zeeman interaction is taken into account exactly.

    Example: ::

  The program reads two integer numbers: :math:`n_{\text{sym}}` and :math:`n_{\text{grid}}`. The :math:`n_{\text{sym}}` defines which
  part of the sphere is used for averaging. It takes one of the three values: 1 (half-sphere),
  2 (a quater of a sphere) or 3 (an octant of the sphere). :math:`n_{\text{grid}}` takes values from 1
  (the smallest grid) till 32 (the largest grid, i.e. the densiest). The default is to
  consider integration over a half-sphere (since :math:`M(H)=-M(-H)`): :math:`n_{\text{sym}}=1` and :math:`n_{\text{grid}}=15`
  (i.e. 185 points distributed over half-sphere). In case of symmetric compounds, powder
  magnetization may be averaged over a smaller part of the sphere, reducing thus the number
  of points for the integration. The user is responsible to choose the appropriate integration scheme.
  Default value for :math:`n_{\text{grid}}=15` (185 directions equally distributed in the given area).

            <HELP>
            This program is used to construct ANO type basis sets.
            </HELP>

:program:`GENANO` is a program for
determining the contraction coefficients for
generally contracted basis sets :cite:`Raffenetti:73`.
They are determined by diagonalizing a density matrix,
using the eigenvectors (natural orbitals) as
the contraction coefficients, resulting
in basis sets of the :index:`ANO` (:index:`Atomic Natural Orbitals`)
type :cite:`Almlof:87`.

.. compound::

  Some elementary theory: We can do a spectral resolution of a density matrix :math:`D`

  .. math:: D=\sum_k \eta_k c_k c_k^{\text{T}}
     :label: eqn:d-spectral

  where :math:`\eta_k` is the :math:`k`\th eigenvalue (occupation value)
  and :math:`c_k` is the :math:`k`\th eigenvector (natural orbital).
  The occupation number for a natural orbital is a
  measure of how much this orbital contributes to
  the total one-electron density.
  A natural choice is to disregard the natural orbitals
  with small occupation numbers and use those with large
  occupation numbers to form contracted basis functions as

  .. math:: \varphi_k=\sum_i c_{ki} \chi_i

  where :math:`\chi_i` is the :math:`i`\th primitive basis function.

As a generalization to this approach we can
average over density
matrices from several wave functions, resulting
in basis sets of the density matrix averaged ANO type,
see for example :cite:`anoI,anoII,anoIII,anoIV`.
We can view the averaging of density matrices as a sequence
of rank-1 updates in the same way as in equation :eq:`eqn:d-spectral`.
We have more update vectors than the rank of the matrix, but this
does not really change anything. The important observation is
that all :math:`\eta`\s are positive and no information is lost
in the averaging.

The general guideline for which wave functions to include is
based on what you want to be able to describe.
All wave functions you want an accurate description of
should be included in the averaging.

As an example, let us consider the oxygen atom.
We want to be able to describe the atom by itself accurately,
thus a wave function for the atom is needed, usually at the CI level.
In molecular systems, oxygen usually has a negative charge, thus
including :math:`\ce{O-}` is almost mandatory.
A basis set derived from these two wave function is well
balanced for the majority of systems containing oxygen.
A logical conclusion would be that you need to include a few
*molecular* wave functions of systems containing oxygen, but in
practice this is not necessary. This is due to the fact that
the degrees of freedom describing the orbital shape distortion
when forming bonds are virtually identical to the lowest
correlating orbitals.
On the other hand, a few molecular species have oxygen with
positive charge, thus it may be appropriate to include
:math:`\ce{O+}` in the basis set.

.. compound::

  A wide range of specialized basis sets can also be generated,
  for example a molecular basis set describing Rydberg orbitals,
  see the example in the "Tutorials and Examples" part,
  section :ref:`TUT:sec:make_rydberg_basis_sets`.
  There is a possibility to create Rydberg orbitals
  automatically by using the keyword
  :kword:`RYDBERG`. Here all unoccupied orbitals with
  negative orbital energies will be used with the associated
  occupation numbers

  .. math:: \eta_k = e^{6.9(\epsilon_k/\epsilon_0-1)}

  where :math:`\epsilon_k` is the orbital energy of orbital :math:`k` and
  :math:`\epsilon_0` is the lowest orbital energy of all
  virtual orbitals. In order to use this option you need
  to use the
  :program:`SCF` or :program:`RASSCF` program to compute
  the orbitals for a cationic system.

You need one or more wave functions,
represented by formatted orbital files,
to generate the average density matrix.
These natural orbital files can be produced by any of the
wave function generators
:program:`SCF`,
:program:`RASSCF`,
:program:`MRCI` or
:program:`CPF`.
You could also use
:program:`MBPT2` or
:program:`CASPT2`.
This approach has been used in the generation of the ANO-RCC basis sets.
Your specific requirements dictate the choice of
wave function generator, but :program:`MRCI` would
be most commonly used.

You are not restricted to atomic calculations but
can mix molecular and atomic calculations freely.
The restrictions are that the name of the center, for which
you are constructing a basis set, must be the same
in all wave functions.
The center may not be "degenerate", i.e.
it may not generate other centers through symmetry
operations. See the description of :program:`SEWARD`
on :ref:`UG:sec:seward`
for a more extensive discussion.
For example for :math:`\ce{O2}` you cannot use :math:`D_{2h}` symmetry
since this would involve one center that is mirrored into the other.
Another restriction is, of course, that you must use the
same primitive set in all calculations.

.. _UG\:sec\:genano_dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

:program:`GENANO` needs one or more wave functions in the
form of natural orbitals. Thus you need to run one or
more of
:program:`SCF`,
:program:`RASSCF`,
:program:`MRCI` or
:program:`CPF`.
You could also use, for example, :program:`MBPT2` or :program:`CASPT2`
but this is in general not recommended.
:program:`GENANO` also needs the one electron file
:file:`ONEINT` and the :file:`RUNFILE` generated by :program:`SEWARD`.

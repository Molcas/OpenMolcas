            The SCF program of the molcas program system generates
            closed-shell Hartree-Fock, open-shell UHF, and Kohn Sham DFT wave functions.
            </HELP>

The :program:`SCF` program of the |molcas| program system generates
closed-shell Hartree--Fock, open-shell UHF, and Kohn Sham DFT wave functions.

The construction of the Fock
matrices is either done conventionally from the two-electron integral
file :file:`ORDINT`,
which was generated in a previous step by the :program:`SEWARD`
integral code, or alternatively (only for closed shell calculations)
integral-direct by recomputing all the
two-electron integrals when needed :cite:`AlmlofFaegriKorsell_DirSCF`.
The later route is recommended for
large basis sets or molecules, when the two-electron integral file would
become extensively large. It is automatically taken, when the :program:`SCF`
program cannot find any :file:`ORDINT` file in the work directory.
The direct Fock matrix construction employs an efficient integral prescreening
scheme, which is based on differential densities
:cite:`CremerGauss_SCFprescreening,HaeserAhlrichs_SCFprescreening`: only
those AO integrals are computed, where the estimated contractions with the
related differential density matrix elements give significant (Coulomb or
exchange) contributions to the (differential) two-electron part of the Fock
matrix. Integral prescreening is performed at two levels, (i) at the level
of shell quadruples, and (ii) at the level of individual primitive Gaussians.
Prescreening at the level of contracted functions is not supported, because
this would be inefficient in the context of a general contraction scheme.
In order to work with differential density and Fock matrices, a history of
these entities over previous iterations has to be kept. All these matrices
are partly kept in memory, and partly held on disk. The :program:`SCF` program
either works with simple differences of the actual and the previous density,
or alternatively with minimized densities, obtained from linear combinations
of the actual density and all the previous minimized densities.

Besides the conventional and the fully-direct algorithms there is also a
semi-direct path, which allows for the storage of some of the AO integrals
during the first iteration, which then are retrieved from disk in subsequent
iterations. That path is taken, if the keyword :kword:`DISK` with an
appropriate
argument specifying the amount of AO integrals to store is found on the
input stream. The semi-direct path is recommended for medium sized problems,
where the two-electron integral file would become a bit too large (but not
orders of magnitude).

.. compound::

  The program contains a feature that allows you to make the
  orbitals partially populated during the aufbau procedure.
  This feature is not primarily intended to accelerate the convergence
  but rather to ensure that you do get convergence in
  difficult cases.
  The orbitals are populated with with electrons according to

  .. math:: \eta_i=\frac{2}{1+e^{(\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_f)/kT}}

  where
  :math:`\varepsilon_i`
  is the orbital energy of orbital :math:`i` and
  :math:`\varepsilon_f`
  is the Fermi energy.
  In this "Fermi aufbau" procedure
  the temperature is slowly lowered until it reaches a minimum
  value and then kept constant until
  a stable closed shell configuration is determined.
  Then normal SCF iterations will be performed with the selected
  closed shell configuration.
  For systems that are not really closed shell systems, for example
  diradicals, you might end up in the situation that the program
  does not find any stable closed shell configuration.
  In that case it will continue to optimize the closed shell
  energy functional with partial occupation numbers.
  If this is the case, this is probably what you want, and such
  orbitals would be ideal as starting orbitals for an MCSCF
  calculation.

The initial orbital guess is either obtained by diagonalizing the bare nuclei
Hamiltonian, from an initial guess produced by the module :program:`Guessorb`
or from orbitals of a previous Hartree--Fock SCF calculation.
These starting orbitals are automatically located in the order

#. SCF orbitals from a previous calculation located in the :file:`RUNFILE`

#. SCF orbitals from a previous calculation located in a formatted orbitals file, :file:`INPORB`.

#. initial guess orbitals from module :program:`Guessorb` located in the :file:`RUNFILE` and

The program has three types of convergence accelerating schemes:
(i) dynamic damping :cite:`Karlstroem_SCFdyndumping`, (ii) the :math:`C^2`\-DIIS method
using the orbital gradient as error vector :cite:`c2-diis`, and (iii)
a combined second-order update/\ :math:`C^2`\-DIIS procedure. The latter eliminates the
Brillouin violating elements of the Fock matrix by proper orbital rotations
and hence avoids diagonalization of the Fock matrix: the approximate inverse
Hessian is updated (BFGS) in a first step, and then the new orbital
displacement vector is obtained from the updated Hessian using :math:`C^2`\-DIIS
extrapolation :cite:`FischerAlmloef_OrbRot`.
Dynamic damping gives substantial improvements in highly anharmonic
regions of the energy hyper surface, while the second-order
update/\ :math:`C^2`\-DIIS procedure exhibits excellent convergence for less anharmonic
regions. By default, dynamic damping is used during the first few iterations.
When the change in the density between two subsequent iterations drops below
a certain threshold the second-order update/\ :math:`C^2`\-DIIS procedure kicks in.
It is also possible to use the older first order :math:`C^2`\-DIIS scheme instead of
the second-order update/\ :math:`C^2`\-DIIS procedure by setting the density threshold
for the latter to zero in the corresponding input card (keyword
:kword:`QNRThreshold`).

By default :program:`SCF` behaves in different ways depending on what
kind of start orbitals are found according to

#. No start orbitals are found. In this case the core hamiltonian
   is diagonalized and these orbitals are used as start.
   The "Fermi aufbau" procedure is used until a stable configuration is found.

#. Start orbitals from :program:`Guessorb` are found.
   In this case the HOMO LUMO gap is analyzed and if it is small
   the "Fermi aufbau" procedure is used until a stable configuration is found.
   Otherwise the configuration suggested by :program:`Guessorb` is used.

#. Start orbitals from a previous :program:`SCF` calculation is found.
   The configuration from the previous :program:`SCF` calculation is used,
   unless some problem is detected such as partial occupation numbers
   from an unconverged calculation. In the latter case "Fermi aufbau" is used.

#. Start orbitals from an :file:`INPORB` is in the same way as for
   start orbitals from an :program:`SCF` calculation, see last point.

This behavior can be changed by suitable keywords described below.

One of the main objects of the :program:`SCF` program in the context of the
|molcas| program system is to generate starting
orbitals for subsequent MCSCF calculations.
Two options are available to
improve the canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals in this respect.

(i) It is possible to specify pseudo occupation numbers that are neither
zero nor two, thus simulating to some extent an open shell system. The
resulting wavefunction does not have any physical meaning, but will
provide better starting orbitals for open shell systems.

(ii) Usually, the lowest virtual canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals are
too diffuse as correlating orbitals in an MCSCF calculation.
If the keyword :kword:`IVO` is encountered in the input stream, the
:program:`SCF` program will diagonalize the core Hamiltonian matrix within
the virtual space and write the resulting more compact eigenvectors to the
:file:`SCFORB` and :file:`RUNFILE` files,
rather than the virtual eigenvectors of the Fock
matrix. It should be noted, that this option must never be used, if the
:program:`SCF` wave function itself is used subsequently as a reference
function: no MP2 or coupled cluster calculations after an
:program:`SCF` run with :kword:`IVO`!

A further method to generate starting orbitals for MCSCF calculations is
to perform an SCF calculation for a slightly positively charged moiety.

Dependencies
------------

The :program:`SCF` program requires the one-electron integral file
:file:`ONEINT` and the communications file :file:`RUNFILE`,
which contains among others the
basis set specifications processed by :program:`SEWARD`. For conventional
(not integral-direct) runs the two-electron integral file :file:`ORDINT`
is required as well. All these files are generated by a preceding
:program:`SEWARD` run.

  Below follows a description of the associated options.
  The options may be given in any order,
  and they are all optional except for
  :kword:`ENDChoinput` which marks the end of the :kword:`CHOInput` section.

  * :kword:`NoLK`
    Available only within :kword:`ChoInput`. Deactivates the "Local Exchange" (LK) screening algorithm :cite:`Aquilante:07a` in computing
    the Fock matrix. The loss of speed compared to the default algorithm can be substantial, especially for electron-rich systems.
    Default is to use LK.

  * :kword:`DMPK`
    Available only within :kword:`ChoInput`. Modifies the thresholds used in the LK screening.
    The keyword takes as argument a (double precision) floating point (non-negative) number used
    as correction factor for the LK screening thresholds.
    The default value is 1.0d0. A smaller value results in a slower but more accurate calculation.

    **Note:** The default choice of the LK screening thresholds is tailored to achieve as much as possible an
    accuracy of the converged SCF energy consistent with the choice of the Cholesky decomposition
    threshold.

  * :kword:`NODEcomposition`
    Available only within :kword:`ChoInput`. Deactivates the Cholesky decomposition of the AO 1-particle density matrix.
    The Exchange contribution to the Fock matrix is therefore computed using occupied canonical orbitals
    instead of (localized) "Cholesky MOs" :cite:`Aquilante:06a`. This choice tends to lower the performances of the
    LK screening.
    Default is to perform this decomposition in order to obtain the Cholesky MOs.

:kword:`THREsholds`
  Specifies convergence thresholds. Four individual thresholds are specified
  as arguments, which have to be fulfilled simultaneously to reach convergence:
  EThr, DThr and FThr
  specify the maximum permissible difference in energy, density matrix elements
  and Fock matrix elements, respectively, in the last two iterations. The
  DltNTh finally specifies the norm of the orbital displacement vector used
  for the orbital rotations in the second-order/\ :math:`C^2`\-DIIS procedure.
  The corresponding values are read in the order given above.
  The default values are 1.0d-9, 1.0d-4, 1.5d-4, and 0.2d-4,
  respectively.
  **Note** that these thresholds automatically define the threshold
  used in the direct Fock matrix construction to estimate individual

Keywords for direct calculations
................................

*Note* again that the threshold for contributions to
the Fock matrix depends on the convergence thresholds
mentioned above. The choice between the conventional and direct SCF
methods is based on the presence of a two-electron integral file
(file :file:`ORDINT`). The keyword
:kword:`Direct` in the :program:`SEWARD` input controls that no
two-electron integral file is to be generated and that integral direct
algorithms can be used in subsequent modules. Thus, *the
choice between conventional and direct SCF is done already in the input
for the integral program* :program:`SEWARD`. The direct (or semi-direct)
path will be taken whenever there are no two-electron integrals available.

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`CONVentional`
  This option will override the automatic choice between the conventional
  and the direct SCF algorithm such that the conventional method will
  be executed regardless of the status of the :file:`ORDINT` file.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: conventional <advanced>
              This option will override the automatic choice between the conventional
              and the direct SCF algorithm such that the conventional method will
              be executed regardless of the status of the ORDINT file.

:kword:`DISK`
  This option enables/disables the semi-direct algorithm. It requires
  two arguments which specifies the max Mbyte of integrals that are written
  on disk during the first iteration (and retrieved later in subsequent
  iterations)
  and the size of the corresponding I/O buffer in kbyte.
  The default values are
  2000 MByte and 512 kByte. In case the specified disk space is zero and the I/O buffer
  is different from zero it will default to a semi-direct SCF with in-core storage
  of the integrals. The size of the memory for integrals storage is the size of the
  I/O buffer. If the size of the disk is non-zero and the I/O buffer size is zero the
  latter will be reset to the default value.

              </KEYWORD>

:kword:`THIZe`
  This option specifies a threshold for two-electron integrals.
  Only integrals above this threshold (but not necessarily all of those) are kept
  on disk for the semi-direct algorithm.
  The keyword takes as argument a (double precision) floating point number.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Thize <advanced>

              The keyword takes as argument a (double precision) floating point number.

:kword:`SIMPle`
  If this option is specified, only a simple prescreening scheme,
  based solely on the
  estimated two-electron integral value will be employed (no density involved).

Limitations
...........

The limitations/MODULE on the number of basis functions are the same as specified
for :program:`SEWARD`.

Input examples
..............

First we have the bare minimum of input. This will work well for almost
all systems containing an even number of electrons. ::

  &SCF

The next example is almost as simple. Here we have an open shell case,
i.e. you have an odd number of electrons in the neutral system and you
need to generate starting orbitals for :program:`RASSCF`.
In this case we recommend that you perform a calculation on the
cation with the input below. ::

  &SCF; Charge= 1

The next example explains how to run UHF code for a nitrogen atom: ::

  &SCF; UHF; ZSPIN=3

The next example is a bit more elaborate and show how to use
a few of the keywords. The system is water that have the
electron configuration :math:`\text{1a}_1^2 \text{2a}_1^2 \text{3a}_1^2 \text{1b}_1^2 \text{1b}_2^2`. ::

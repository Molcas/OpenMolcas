            <HELP>
            The RASSI program calculates overlaps, and matrix
            elements of one-electron operators, and of the electronic Hamiltonian,
            over a basis of RASSCF wave functions, which may each have its own
            independent set of orbitals. Energies and matrix elements are
            computed also for the non-interacting linear combinations of states,
            i.e., doing a limited CI using the RASSCF states as a non-orthogonal basis.
            RASSI is extensively used for computing dipole oscillator strengths.
            Finally, it can also compute e.g. spin-orbit interaction matrix elements,
            transition dipole moments, (bi-)natural orbitals and other quantities.
            </HELP>

The
:program:`RASSI` (RAS :index:`State Interaction`) program forms overlaps and
other :index:`matrix
elements <single: Matrix elements; RASSCF>` of the Hamiltonian and other operators
over a wave function basis, which consists of RASSCF wave functions,
each with an individual set of orbitals. It is extensively used
for computing dipole :index:`oscillator strengths <single: Oscillator strength>`, but any
one-electron operator, for which the :program:`Seward` has computed
integrals to the :file:`ORDINT` file, can be used, not just dipole
moment components.

Also, it solves the Schrödinger
equation projected on the space spanned by these wave functions,
i.e., it forms non-interacting linear combinations of the input
state functions, and computes matrix elements over the resulting
eigenbasis as well.

Finally, using these spin-free eigenstates as a basis, it can
compute spin--orbit interaction matrix elements, diagonalize
the resulting matrix, and compute various matrix elements over
the resulting set of spin--orbit eigenstates.

If only matrix
elements of some one-electron operator(s), such as the dipole
transition moments, are required, the calculation of Hamiltonian
matrix elements and the transformation to the eigenbasis of this
matrix can be skipped. However, if any states have the same symmetry
and different orbitals, it is desirable to use the transitions strengths
as computed between properly non-interacting and orthonormal states.
The reason is that the individually optimized RASSCF states are
interacting and non-orthogonal, and the main error in the computed
transition matrix elements is the difference in electronic dipole
moment times the overlap of any two states involved. For excited
states, the overlap is often in the order of 10%.

Please note: Due to the increasing number of calculations done with
a hundred input states, or more, there has been a demand to change
the output. Until |molcas| 6.2, the default assumption has been to print
all expectation values and matrix elements that can be computed from
the selection of one-electron integrals. From 6.4, this is requested by
keywords, see the keyword list below for XVIN, XVES, XVSO, MEIN,
MEES, and MESO.

Apart from computing oscillator strengths, overlaps and Hamiltonian
matrix elements can be used to compute :index:`electron transfer rates <single: Electron transfer rate>`, or
to form :index:`quasi-diabatic states <single: Quasi-diabatic states>` and reexpress matrix elements over a
basis of such states.

The CSF space of a RASSCF wave function is closed under deexcitation.
For any given pair of RASSCF wave functions, this is used in the
way described in reference :cite:`Malmqvist:86` to allow the pair of orbital
sets to be transformed to a biorthonormal pair, while simultaneously
transforming the CI expansion coefficients so that the wave functions
remain unchanged. The basic principles are the same as in the earlier
program :cite:`Malmqvist:89`, but is adapted to allow RASSCF as well as
CASSCF wave functions. It uses internally a Slater determinant
expansion. It can now use spin-dependent operators,
including the AMFI spin--orbit operator, and can compute matrix elements
over spin--orbit states, i.e. the eigenstates of the sum of the
spin-free hamiltonian and the spin--orbit operator.

One use of the RASSI eigenstates is to resolve ambiguities due
to the imperfect description of highly excited states.
Association between individually optimized states and the exact
electronic eigenstates is often not clear, when the calculation
involves several or many excited states. The reason is that the
different states each use a different set of orbitals. The State
Interaction calculation gives an unambiguous set of non-interacting and
orthonormal eigenstates to the projected Schrödinger equation, and
also the overlaps between the original RASSCF wave functions and the
eigenstates. The latter is a very efficient diagnostic, since it
describes the RASSCF states in terms of one single wave-function basis
set.

.. index::
   single: RASSCF; Multiple solutions

To make the last point clear, assume the following situation:
We have
performed three RASSCF calculations, one where we optimize for the
lowest state, one for the first excited state, and one for the 2nd
excited state in the same symmetry. The active orbitals are fairly
much mixed around, so a simple inspection of the CI coefficient is
insufficient for comparing the states. Assume that for each state, we
have calculated the three lowest CI roots. It can now happen, that the
2nd root of each calculation is a fair approximation to the exact 2nd
eigenstate, and the same with the 3rd, or possibly that the order gets
interchanged in one or two of the calculation. In that case, a RASSI
calculation with these 9 states will give three improved solutions
close to the original ones, and of course 6 more that are considered
to be the removed garbage. The overlaps will confirm that each of the
input states consists mainly of one particular out of the three lowest
eigenstates. This situation is the one we usually assume, if no
further information is available.

However, it happens that the active orbitals of the three calculations
do not span approximately the same space. The orbital optimization
procedure has made a qualitatively different selection of correlating
orbitals for the three different calculation. Then the :program:`RASSI`
calculation may well come out with 4 lowest roots that overlap
strongly with the original RASSCF states. This may change the
assignments and may also give valuable information about the
importance of some state. The natural orbitals of the eigenstates will
show that the active space used in the RASSCF was in some way
inappropriate.

Another bothersome situation is also solved by the RASSI method. The
analysis of the original states in terms of RASSI eigenstates may
reveal that the three optimized RASSCF states consists mainly of TWO
low RASSI eigenstates! This is because the RASSCF optimization
equations are non-linear and may sometimes offer spurious extra
solutions. Two of the calculations are in this case to be regarded
qualitatively, as two different (local) solutions that
approximate (imperfectly) the same excited state. Also in this case, the
natural orbitals will probably offer a clue to how to get rid of the
problem. Extra solutions rarely occur for low states in CASSCF
calculations, provided a generous active space can be afforded.
Problems occur when the active space is too small, and in
particular with general RASSCF calculations.

A further application is the preparation of a suitable orbital basis
for a subsequent CI calculation. Note that such an application also
allows the use of badly converged RASSCF wave functions, or of RASSCF
wave functions containing multiple minima solutions close to a common
exact eigenstate. In effect, the :program:`RASSI` program cleans up the situation
by removing the errors due to bad convergence (pushing the errors into
a garbage part of the spectrum). This requires that the set of input
states (9 in this example) provides flexibility enough to remove at
least a major part of the error. As one would expect, this is usually
true: The erratic non-convergent, or the too slowly convergent, error
mode is to a large extent spanned by the few lowest RASSCF wave
functions.

Finally, there are situations where there is no problem to obtain
adiabatic RASSCF solutions, but where it is still imperative to use
RASSI natural orbitals in a subsequent CI. Consider the case of
transition metal chemistry, where there is in general two or more
electronic states involved. These states are supposed to interact
strongly, at least within some range of interatomic distances. Here,
an MCSCF solution, such as RASSCF, will have at least two very
different solutions, one associated with each configuration of the
transition metal atom. Using one set of orbitals, one electronic state
has a reasonably described potential energy curve, while other states
get pushed far up in energy. Using another set of orbitals, another
state gets correctly described. In no calculation with a single
orbital set do we obtain the avoided crossings, where one switches
from one diabatic state to another. The only way to accomplish this is
via a RASSI calculation. In this case, it is probably necessary also to
shift the energies of the RASSCF states to ensure that the crossing
occur at the correct places. The shifts can be determined by
correcting the atomic spectrum in the separated-atoms limit.

Note, however, that most of the problems described above can be
solved by performing state-averaged RASSCF calculations.

.. In the latest version of |molcas|, derivatives of transition dipole moments
   have been added to RASSI :cite:`Bernhardsson:99b`. The derivatives are
   calculated as the matrix element of the product of the (CI/orbital)
   rotation operator and the dipole moment operator.

Dependencies
------------

The :program:`RASSI` program needs one or more :file:`JOBIPH` files produced
by the :program:`RASSCF` program. Also, it needs a :file:`ONEINT` file from
:program:`SEWARD`, with overlap integrals and any one-electron
property integrals for the requested matrix elements. If Hamiltonian
matrix elements are used, also the :file:`ORDINT` file is needed.

.. For derivatives the :program:`RASSI` needs the :file:`MCKINT` file
   produced by :program:`MCKINLEY` and :program:`MCLR` containing
   the derivatives of the dipole operator and the orbital rotations and the
   state transfer operators.

   The existence of a file with the name :file:`MCKINT1` will automatically
   change :program:`RASSI` to from ordinary calculation of state interaction
   properties, to calculation of derivatives of state interaction properties,
   like transition dipole derivatives and non adiabatic coupling constants.

   It is important that if derivatives of state interaction properties should
   be calculated, the expansion center for that property must be (0,0,0).
   For derivatives of transition dipole moments, the following keyword has to be
   added to the :program:`SEWARD` input. ::

     Center= 1; 1 0.0 0.0 0.0

:kword:`NTOCalc`
  Enables natural transition orbital (NTO) calculation of two states from two JobIph files (which can be identical to each other).
  The NTO calculations can be performed for states with different spatial symmetries.
  To perform an NTO calculation, two JobIph files, which by convention are named :file:`JOB001` and :file:`JOB002`, are needed. Since NTO calculations are performed usually between the ground state and an excited state, :file:`JOB001` is used to provide the information for the ground state, and :file:`JOB002` is used to provide the information for excited states. This way of storing information was chosen so that NTO calculations can be performed either for states with the same symmetry or states with different symmetries, but in the former case, if two states are obtained in a single SA-CASSCF or SA-RASSCF calculation, one may make a copy of the JobIph file to get the second JobIph file. The two states are specified in the keyword :kword:`NROF` to tell the program for which two states the NTO calculation is to be performed.
  The NTO files are named as :file:`$Project.NTOrb.I_J.Spin.NTOType`, which has the same format as :file:`.ScfOrb` or :file:`.RasOrb`, where :file:`Spin` is `a` for alpha NTOs and `b` for beta NTOs, and where :file:`I` and :file:`J` are the RASSI states between which the NTOs are calculated, and where :file:`NTOType` is `PART` for particle NTOs and `HOLE` for hole NTOs.
  One may search for ``Nr of states`` in the RASSI part of the output and the three lines after this information tell the correspondence of the RASSI states (in the line starting with ``State:``) with the actual states (in the line starting with ``Root nr:``) in each JobIph file (in the line starting with ``JobIph:``). If the states for which the NTO calculation is performed are singlets, only the alpha NTOs are printed out.

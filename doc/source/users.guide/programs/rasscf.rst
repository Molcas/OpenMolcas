            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The RASSCF program generates CASSCF, RASSCF, GASSCF and Stochastic-CASSCF type wave functions.
            It requires the one- and two-electron integral files generated by
            SEWARD, and starting orbitals from either a previous RASSCF
            calculation or from any of the other wave function generating programs,
            or from the GUESSORB facility.
            The RASSCF module can be used also for Multiconfiguration
            Pair-Density Functional Theory (MC-PDFT) calculations.
            The resulting orbitals can be visualized, e.g. by LUSCUS.
            </HELP>

The :program:`RASSCF` program in |molcas| performs
multiconfigurational SCF calculations using the Complete Active Space (CAS) :cite:`caspek1,Roos:87`, Restricted Active
Space (RAS) :cite:`raspek` or the Generalized Active Space (GAS) :cite:`gas2011` SCF construction of the wave function.

Within the :program:`RASSCF` program in |molcas| Stochastic-CASSCF calculations can be performed :cite:`limanni2016`.
The Stochastic-CASSCF method allows for CASSCF calculations with a large active space selection (calculations with about
40 electrons and 40 orbitals have been reported) :cite:`limanni2016,limanni2018,limanni2019`.

The RASSCF method is based on a partitioning of the occupied molecular
orbitals into the following groups:

* **Inactive orbitals:** Orbitals that are doubly occupied in all
  configurations.

* **Active orbitals:** These orbitals are subdivided into three separate
  groups:

  * **RAS1 orbitals:** Orbitals that are doubly occupied except for
    a maximum number of holes allowed in this orbital subspace.

  * **RAS2 orbitals:** In these orbitals all possible occupations are
    allowed (former Complete Active Space orbitals).

  * **RAS3 orbitals:** Orbitals that are unoccupied except for
    a maximum number of electrons allowed in this subspace.

CASSCF (or Stochastic-CASSCF) calculations can be performed with the program, by allowing
orbitals only in the RAS2 space. For building more general GASSCF wave functions read the dedicated section below.

A single reference SDCI wave function is obtained by allowing a maximum of 2 holes in RAS1 and a maximum of
2 electrons in RAS3, while RAS2 is empty (the extension to SDT- and SDTQ-CI is
obvious). Multireference CI wave functions can be constructed by adding orbitals also in RAS2.

The :program:`RASSCF` program is based on the split GUGA formalism.
However, it uses determinant based algorithms to solve the configuration
interaction problem :cite:`rasdet`. To ensure a proper spin function,
the transformation to a determinant basis is only performed in the
innermost loops of the program to evaluate the :math:`\sigma`\-vectors in the
Davidson procedure and to compute the two-body density matrices.
The upper limit to the size of the CASSCF wave function that can be
handled with the present program is about :math:`10^7` CSFs and is,
in general, limited by the dynamic work array available to the
program. The GUGA formalism is available both for CAS, RAS and GAS wave functions.

The orbital optimization in the :program:`RASSCF` program is performed
using the super-CI method. The reader is referred to the
references :cite:`raspek,caspek3` for more details.
A quasi-Newton (QN) update method is used in order to improve
convergence. No explicit CI-orbital coupling is used in the present
version of the program, except for the coupling introduced in the QN
update.

Convergence of the orbital optimization procedure is normally good for
CASSCF type wave functions, but problems can occur in calculations on
excited states, especially when several states are close in energy.
In such applications it is better to optimize the orbitals for the
average energy of several electronic states.
Further, convergence can be slower in some cases when orbitals in RAS1
and RAS3 are included. The program is not optimal for SDCI
calculations with a large number of orbitals in RAS1 and RAS3.
Also for the GASSCF variant a slower convergence might occur.

As with other program modules, please observe that the input is preprocessed
and may therefore differ in some respects to the input file prepared by the
user. In most cases, this does not imply any functional changes as
compared to the user's requests. However, when the input
has some minor mistakes or contradictory requests, it can be modified
when it is felt that the correction is beneficial. Also, see below for
the keyword :kword:`EXPERT`. Without this keyword, the program is
assuming more flexibility to optimize the calculation, e.g. by using
CIRESTART, if the RASSCF module is called during a numerical differentiation,
even if the input requested doing CI calculations from scratch.
Using keyword :kword:`EXPERT`, such automatic modification of the
user's input is no longer done, and the input is obeyed exactly (when
possible).

It is best to provide a set of good input orbitals.
(The program can be started from scratch by using :kword:`CORE`,
but this should be used only if other possibilities fail).
They can either be from some
other type of calculation, for example :program:`SCF`, or generated by
:program:`GUESSORB`, or from a previous
:program:`RASSCF` calculation on the same system. In the first case the
orbitals are normally given in formatted form, file :file:`INPORB`, in the
second case they can also be read from a :program:`RASSCF` input unit
:file:`JOBOLD`.
Input provides both possibilities. Some care has to be taken in choosing the
input orbitals, especially for the weakly occupied ones. Different choices
may lead to convergence to different local minima. One should therefore make
sure that the input orbitals have the correct general structure. A good strategy
is often to start using a smaller basis set (MB or DZ) and once the orbitals
have been defined, increase the basis set and use :program:`EXPBAS` to generate
input orbitals.

When we speak of files like :file:`INPORB` or :file:`JOBIPH`, please note that
these can be regarded as generic names. You may have various files with different
file names available, and when invocating the :program:`RASSCF` program, these
can be linked or copied (See EMIL command LINK and COPY) so that the program
treats them as having the names INPORB or JOBIPH. Alternatively, by the keywords
:kword:`FILEORB` and :kword:`IPHNAME`, you can instruct the program to use
other file names.

There are two kinds of specifications to make for orbitals: One is the coefficient
arrays that describe the molecular orbitals, commonly called "CMO data". The other
kind is the number of inactive, RAS1, etc. orbitals of each symmetry type, which
will be called "orbital specifications". The
program can take either or both kinds of data from :file:`INPORB`, :file:`JOBIPH`
or runfile. The program selects where to fetch such data, based on rules and
input keywords. Avoid using conflicting keywords: the program may sometimes go
ahead and resolve the problem, or it may decide to stop, not to risk wasting
the user's time on a calculation that was not intended. This decision may be
in error.

The orbital specification by keyword input is easy: See keywords :kword:`FROZEN`,
:kword:`INACTIVE`, etc. If any such keyword is used, then all the orbital
specifications are assumed to be by input, and any such input that is lacking
is determined by default rules. These are
that there are no such orbitals, with the exception of
:kword:`DELETED`: If earlier calculations deleted some orbitals for reason of
(near) linear dependence, then these will continue being deleted in subsequent
calculations, and cannot be "undeleted". Another special case occurs if both
:kword:`CHARGE` and :kword:`NACTEL` are given in the input and there is no
symmetry, then the default value of :kword:`INACTIVE` will be automatically
determined.

If no such keyword has been given, but keyword :kword:`LUMORB` is used to instruct
the program to fetch CMO data from :file:`INPORB`, then also the orbitals specs
are taken from :file:`INPORB`, if (as is usually the case) this file contains
so-called **typeindex** information. The :program:`LUSCUS` program may have been
used to graphically view orbital pictures and pick out suitable active orbitals,
etc., producing a file with extension ".GvOrb". When this is used as :file:`INPORB`
file, the selected orbitals will be picked in the correct order.

An :file:`INPORB` file with typeindex can also be used to provide orbital specs while
the CMO data are taken from another source (:file:`JOBOLD`, :file:`RUNFILE`, ...).
This is achieved by :kword:`TYPEINDEX`, and you can look in the manual for this
keyword to see an explanation of how the typeindex is written. (This is usually
done by the program generating the file, but since these are ASCII files, you may
find it expedient to look at, or edit, the typeindex).

In case both keywords, such as :kword:`INACTIVE`, **and** :kword:`LUMORB`, is
given, this is of course the very common case that CMO data are read from :file:`INPORB`
but orbital specs are given by input. This is perhaps the most common usage.
However, when the :file:`INPORB` file is a produced by :program:`GV`, it happens
frequently that also keyword specs are left in the input, since the user knows
that these merely duplicate the specs in :file:`INPORB`. But the latter may also
imply a reordering of the orbitals.
For this reason, when the keyword input merely duplicates the number of
inactive, etc., that is also specified by typeindex, then the typeindex input
overrides, to produce the correct ordering. If they do **not** match precisely,
then the CMO data are read, without reordering, and the keyword input (as usual)
takes precedence.

The CMO data are obtained as follows:
With the following keywords, it is assumed that the user knows what he wants.

* :kword:`CORE`: (A bad choice, but here for completeness). Creates orbitals
  from scratch.
* :kword:`LUMORB` or :kword:`FILEORB`: Try :file:`INPORB`, or fail.
* :kword:`JOBIPH`: Try :file:`JOBOLD`, if not usable, try :file:`JOBIPH`, or fail.

If none of these keywords were used, then the user accepts defaults, namely

* look for RASSCF orbitals on :file:`RUNFILE`
* look for SCF orbitals on :file:`RUNFILE`
* look for GUESSORB orbitals on :file:`RUNFILE`
* If still nothing found, create orbitals from scratch.

As for earlier versions, notice the possibility
to read the orbitals on :file:`JOBIPH`, at a later time, by using
the keywords :kword:`OUTOrbital` and :kword:`ORBOnly`. This results in
editable ASCII files, with names like :file:`Project.RasOrb` (or :file:`Project.RasOrb5`
for the fifth root). Such orbitals will be produced by default for the lowest
roots --- up to the tenth, named now, e.g., :file:`Project.RasOrb.5`. There is a keyword :kword:`MAXORB`
to produce more (or fewer) such files.

The :program:`RASSCF` program has special input options, which will limit the degrees of
freedoms used in the orbital rotations. It is, for example, possible to impose
averaging of the orbital densities in :math:`\pi` symmetries for linear molecules.
Use the keyword :kword:`Average` for this purpose. It is also
possible to prevent specific orbitals from rotating with each other. The
keyword is :kword:`Supsym`. This can be used, for example, when the molecule
has higher symmetry than one can use with the |molcas| system. For example, in
a linear molecule the point group to be used is :math:`C_{2v}` or :math:`D_{2h}`. Both
:math:`\sigma`\- and :math:`\delta`\-orbitals will then appear in irrep 1. If the input
orbitals have been prepared to be adapted to linear symmetry, the
:kword:`Supsym` input can be used to keep this symmetry through the iterations.
The program will do this automatically with the use of the
input keyword :kword:`LINEAR`. Similarly, for single atoms, spherical
symmetry can be enforced by the keyword :kword:`ATOM`.

.. _UG\:sec\:core-hole:

States with a core hole
-----------------------

.. compound::

  For stable calculation of states with a deep hole, e.g. for X-ray transitions, one needs to compute
  a (number of) states with a core hole, and a (number of) states without the core hole, with quite
  different orbitals, and then presumably combine these states in a RASSI calculation. The core-hole
  state(s) cannot be computed in the same calculation as the full-core states, since they will be very highly excited states
  compared to the states without that hole. There is also the problem of preventing orbital optimization
  from filling the core hole. In order to make the calculation in a way that is stable, also across
  calculations with changing geometry, there is a special input to :program:`RASSCF`.
  The option :kword:`CRPR` stands for "core projection", and is followed by two numbers, e.g. as ::

      CRPR
        1   33.0

  which has the effect of selecting one orbital, in this case orbital nr. 1, from the starting orbitals.
  This orbital should be in symmetry 1, a non-degenerate orbital, doubly occupied in the state without
  core hole. A projection operator is constructed from the AO basis set, and in the subsequent
  CI calculations, in each new iteration of the orbital optimizer, this operator is multiplied with
  a shift, in this case 33.0 a.u., and added to the Hamiltonian. Regardless of the changing
  orbitals, this operator is defined by the stable AO basis, and any configuration where the core
  orbital is doubly occupied is shifted upwards in energy, above the core hole states, and are
  prevented from playing any role in the calculation. The converged solution(s) are used in a
  subsequent RASSI, for instance (then with the unperturbed Hamiltonian, of course), where it is
  combined with states without core hole, for energies and transition properties.

The perturbation on the core hole states by the projection shift is small, provided that the
basis set is able to to include the core relaxation effect, and the subsequent RASSI is
helpful in correcting for any effects of the perturbation since it will anyway compute
eigenstates which are non-interacting and orthogonal by state mixing.

.. _UG\:sec\:StochasticCAS:

Stochastic-CASSCF method
------------------------

.. warning::

   This program requires an external package to run

The Stochastic-CASSCF :cite:`limanni2016` has been developed since 2015 by Li Manni and Alavi,
initially into a locally modified version of |molcas| and now available in |openmolcas|.
The method retains the simplicity of CASSCF, while circuventing the the exponential scaling of CAS wave functions.
This is obtained by replacing the Davidson diagonalization technique, in its direct-CI implementation (default in |molcas|),
with the full-CI quantum Monte-Carlo (FCIQMC) algorithm :cite:`Alavi2009`, whilst the Super-CI method is used
for the orbital optimization.

The method is compatible with density fitting techniques available within |openmolcas|.
The method is also compatible with subsequent MC-PDFT method to recover correlation outside the active space.

.. _UG\:sec\:StochCAS_dependencies:

Dependencies
............

In addition to the normal :program:`RASSCF` dependencies, the Stochastic-CASSCF requires that the :program:`NECI` program is installed externally
(the :program:`NECI` program can also be embedded into |openmolcas|. This form of installation is however not fully developed and not suggested).
For the :program:`NECI` program a parallel installation (using MPI) is assumed as well as the use of hdf5 libraries to store and process
the walker population. Using the FCIQMC algorithm the user will produce one- and two-body density matrix files (:file:`ONERDM`, :file:`TwoRDM_XXXX`), that are required for the subsequent orbital optimization step.

.. _UG\:sec\:StochCAS_InpOutFiles:

Input/Output Files
..................

Two files are produced by the :program:`RASSCF` module at each MCSCF macro-iteration when the Stochastic-CASSCF method is used (in addition to the one produced by default by :program:`RASSCF`). These files are:

.. class:: filelist

:file:`FCIINP`
  The :file:`$Project.FciInp` (or :file:`FCIINP`) file contains input keywords for the NECI code.
  These keywords need to be adjusted depending on the chemical system under investigation for an optimal FCIQMC dynamics.

:file:`FCIDMP`
  The :file:`$Project.FciDmp` (or :file:`FCIDMP`), also know as FCIDUMP, contains the MO integrals in the active space.
  It is a ASCII formatted file. Indices are sorted by symmetry (Irrep).

The Input and the FCIDUMP files are the only files necessary to :program:`NECI` to run a FCIQMC simulation from scratch.
For questions about the FCIQMC dynamics we invite to contact its developers.

As accurate density matrices are necessary for a successful Stochastic-CASSCF calculation,
users are invited to use the :file:`dneci.x` binary (this will run the FCIQMC dynamic in replica mode) :cite:`Overy2014`.
The FCIQMC dymanics can be followed in the :file:`fciqmc.out` output file or in the NECI generated :file:`FCIMCStats` file.
In the :file:`fciqmc.out` there are important pieces of information, such as the list of Slater determinants dominating the FCI wave function and the RDM energy. The latter is passed to |molcas| as shown in the script below.
When a stationary condition is reached and density matrices sampled these are passed to the :file:`RASSCF` program to continue.
This can be achieved by a simple script, such as the following: ::

  cp TwoRDM_aaaa.1 $WorkDir/$Project.TwoRDM_aaaa
  cp TwoRDM_abab.1 $WorkDir/$Project.TwoRDM_abab
  cp TwoRDM_abba.1 $WorkDir/$Project.TwoRDM_abba
  cp TwoRDM_bbbb.1 $WorkDir/$Project.TwoRDM_bbbb
  cp TwoRDM_baba.1 $WorkDir/$Project.TwoRDM_baba
  cp TwoRDM_baab.1 $WorkDir/$Project.TwoRDM_baab
  cp   OneRDM.1    $WorkDir/$Project.OneRDM
  grep 'REDUCED D' fciqmc.out | sed "s/^.*: //" > NEWCYCLE
  mv NEWCYCLE $WorkDir/.

.. class:: filelist

:file:`$Project.TwoRDM_XXXX`
  These files are ASCII NECI generated output files.
  They contain spin-resolved two-body density matrix elements (and one-RDM) and are necessary
  to |molcas| to continue with the Stochastic-CASSSCF calculation.

.. _UG\:sec\:StochCAS_Keywords:

Input keywords
..............

This section describes the input to the Stochastic-CASSCF method in the |openmolcas| program.
Two input keywords are strictly required in the :program:`RASSCF` module for activating the Stochastic-CASSCF:

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`NECI`
  This keyword is needed to enable the Stochastic-CASSCF method.

  Additional keywords like ``totalwalkers`` have the same meaning as in NECI
  and are just passed on.

              This keyword is used to enable Stochastic-CASSSCF
              calculations and features related to it (such as produce a FCIDUMP file).
              Additional keywords like "totalwalkers" have the
              same meaning as in NECI and are just passed on.
              </HELP>
              </KEYWORD>

:kword:`EMBD`
  This keyword enables the embedded version of the Stochastic-CASSCF where :program:`NECI` runs as subroutine of |molcas|.

              This keyword is used jointly to the NECI keyword in the context of the Stochastic-CASSCF method,
              to enable the embedded Stochastic-CASSSCF
              calculations, where NECI runs as subroutine of Molcas.
              </HELP>
              </KEYWORD>

Optional important keywords are:

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`DMPO`
  This keyword is used to generate the FCIDUMP file only. The program will deallocate memory and quit in a clean manner.

              %%Keyword: DMPO <advanced>

              This keyword is used in the context of the Stochastic-CASSCF method
              to produce a FCIDUMP file in a ASCII format that can be recognized by

              </HELP>
              </KEYWORD>

:kword:`DEFD`
  This keyword is used to define an initial Slater determinant as starting guess for the FCIQMC dynamics.
  During the FCIQMC dynamics, if another Slater determinant is more populated (advanced keywords apply) than the guess determinant
  provided, the more populated determinant is used as reference, overwriting the user choice. Possible changes of reference
  determinants can be tracked in the FCIQMC output file. An example of the :kword:`DEFD` keyword follows: ::

  It contains a list of the occupied spin-orbitals in the order given by the :file:`INPORB` file (space symmetry sorted).

              This keyword is used in the context of the Stochastic-CASSCF method
              to provide the FCIQMC algorithm with an initial guess for the reference Slater determinant.
              It is followed (new line) by a string of integers representing spin-orbitals in the order
              given in the INPORB file.

:kword:`REOR`
  The user can input a permutation by specifying the number of non
  fixed point elements, followed by the order of the non fixed point elements.

     This means that the orbitals are ordered by GAS space first
     and by symmetry second.
     First all orbitals of GAS1 and within it orbitals of Irrep 1 come first,

GASSCF method
-------------

In certain cases it is useful/necessary to enforce restrictions on electronic
excitations within the active space beyond the ones accessible by RASSCF.
These restrictions are meant to remove configurations that contribute only
marginally to the total wave function.
In |molcas| this is obtained by the GASSCF approach :cite:`gas2011`.
GASSCF is a further generalization of the active space concept.
This method, like RASSCF, allows restrictions on the active space,
but they are more flexible than in RASSCF. These restrictions allow GASSCF to be applied to
larger and more complex systems at affordable cost. If the active space is well chosen and the
restrictions are not too severe, MCSCF methods recover most of the static correlation energy,
and part of the dynamic correlation energy. In the GASSCF method, instead
of three active spaces, an in-principle arbitrary number of active spaces (GAS1, GAS2...) may
be chosen by the user. Instead of a maximum number of holes in RAS1 and particles in RAS3,
accumulated minimum and maximum numbers of electrons are specified for GAS1,
GAS1+GAS2, GAS1+GAS2+GAS3, etc. in order to define the desired CI expansion (:numref:`fig:gas`).
All intra-space excitations are allowed (Full-CI in subspaces).
Constraints are imposed by user choice on inter-space excitations.

   Pictorial representation of GAS active space.

When and how to use the GAS approach?
We consider three examples: (1) an organometallic material with separated metal
centers and orbitals not delocalized across the metal centers. One can include
the near degenerate orbitals of each center in its own GAS space.
This implies that one may choose as many GAS spaces as the number of
multiconfigurational centers. (2) Lanthanide or actinide metal compounds where
the :math:`f`-electrons require a MC treatment but they do not participate in bonding
neither mix with :math:`d` orbitals. In this case one can put the :math:`f` orbitals and their
electrons into one or more separated GAS spaces and not allow excitations
from and/or to other GAS spaces. (3) Molecules where each bond and its correlating
anti-bonding orbital could form a separate GAS space as in GVB approach.
Finally, if a wave function with a fixed number of holes in one or more
orbitals is desired, without interference of configurations where those
orbitals are fully occupied the GAS approach is the method of choice instead
of the RAS approach. There is no rigorous scheme to choose a GAS partitioning.
The right GAS strategy is system-specific. This makes the method versatile but
at the same time it is not a black box method.
An input example follows: ::

In this example the entire active space counts six active electrons
and six active orbitals. These latter are partitioned in three GAS spaces
according to symmetry consideration and in the spirit of the GVB strategy.
Each subspace has a fixed number of electrons, *two*, and no interspace
excitations are allowed. This input shows clearly the difference
with the RAS approach.
Also for the GASSCF variant a slower convergence might occur.

MC-PDFT method
--------------

The RASSCF module can be used also for Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory (MC-PDFT) calculations,
as described in :cite:`limanni2014,limanni2015`. The MC-PDFT method involves two steps:
(i) a CASSCF, RASSCF, or GASSCF wave function calculation to obtain the kinetic energy, classical Coulomb energy,
total electron density, and on-top pair density; (ii) a post-SCF calculation of the remaining energy using an on-top density functional.
In the current implementation, the on-top pair density functional is obtained by "translation" (t) of exchange-correlation functionals.
Three translated functionals are currently available: tPBE, tLSDA and tBLYP.
As multiconfigurational wave functions are used as input quantities, spin and space symmetry are correctly conserved.

RASSCF output orbitals
----------------------

The :program:`RASSCF` program produces a binary output file called
:file:`JOBIPH`, which can be used in subsequent calculations. Previously, this
was usually a link, pointing to whichever file the user wanted, or by default
to the file :file:`$Project.JobIph` if no such links had been made. This default
can be changed, see keyword :kword:`NewIph` and :kword:`IphName`.
For simplicity, we refer to this as :file:`JOBIPH` in the manual.The job interface,
:file:`JOBIPH`, contains four different sets of MO's and
it is important to know the difference between the sets:

#. **Average orbitals:**
   These are the orbitals produced in the optimization
   procedure. Before performing the final CI wave function they are
   modified as follows: inactive and secondary orbitals are rotated
   (separately) such as to diagonalize an effective Fock operator, and
   they are then ordered after increasing energy. The orbitals in the
   different RAS subspaces are rotated (within each space separately)
   such that the corresponding block of the state-average density matrix becomes
   diagonal. These orbitals are therefore called "pseudo-natural
   orbitals". They become true natural orbitals only for CAS type wave
   functions. These orbitals are not ordered. The corresponding
   "occupation numbers" may therefore appear in the output in arbitrary
   order. The final CI wave function is computed using these orbitals.
   They are also the orbitals found in the printed output.

#. **Natural orbitals:**
   They differ from the above orbitals, in the active
   subspace. The entire first order density matrix has been diagonalized.
   Note that in a RAS calculation, such a rotation does not in general
   leave the RAS CI space invariant. One set of such orbitals is produced
   for each of the wave functions in an average :program:`RASSCF`
   calculation. The main use of these orbitals is in
   the calculation of one-electron properties. They are extracted by default
   (up to ten roots)
   to the working directory from :file:`JOBIPH` and named :file:`$Project.RasOrb.1`,
   :file:`$Project.RasOrb.2`, etc.
   Each set of MO's is stored together with the
   corresponding occupation numbers. The natural orbitals are identical
   to the average orbitals only for a single state CASSCF wave function.

#. **Canonical orbitals:**
   This is a special set of MO's generated for use in the
   :program:`CASPT2` and :program:`CCSDT` programs.
   They are obtained by a specific input option to the
   :program:`RASSCF` program. They are identical to the above
   orbitals in the inactive and secondary subspaces. The active orbitals
   have been obtained by diagonalizing an effective one-electron
   Hamiltonian, a procedure that leaves the CI space invariant only for
   CAS type wave functions.

#. **Spin orbitals:**
   This set of orbitals is generated by diagonalizing the first order
   spin density matrix and can be used to compute spin properties.

#. **Improved virtual orbitals:**
   This refers only to virtual orbitals, when the :kword:`IVO` keyword is employed
   in the input. In this case, the virtual orbitals are those which diagonalize
   the core Hamiltonian. Since the energies of virtual orbitals become thus undefined,
   the obtained :file:`RASORB` and :file:`JOBIPH` files can **not** be used for CASPT2 or MRCI or any correlated
   calculations. The printed virtual orbitals are quite localized and could be used only to
   decide which ones should be included in an (enlarged) active space in a subsequest
   :program:`RASSCF` calculation.

.. _UG\:sec\:rasscf_dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

To start the :program:`RASSCF` module at least the one-electron
and two-electron integrals generated by :program:`SEWARD` have to
be available (exception: See keyword :kword:`ORBONLY`). Moreover, the
:program:`RASSCF` requires a suitable start wave function such as the
orbitals from a RHF-SCF calculation or produced by :program:`GUESSORB`.

For MC-PDFT calculations, it is recommended to use a fine grid via the following input specifications (see the :program:`SEWARD`, :numref:`UG:sec:seward`, for details): ::

  &SEWARD
  grid input
  grid=ultrafine
  end of grid input

CI coefficients are needed to generate one- and two-body density matrices. They are usually pre-optimized vectors passed to the :program:`RASSCF` module via :program:`EMIL` command: ::

  >>> COPY $WorkDir/$Project.JobIph JOBOLD

A pre-optimized CI vector is not compulsory; however, it is recommended to use a pre-optimized CI vector stored in a :file:`JOBIPH` file.
A set of input orbitals is required. They may be stored in :file:`JOBIPH` or in a formatted :file:`INPORB` file.

.. _UG\:sec\:rasscf_files:

Files

Input files
...........

:program:`RASSCF` will use the following input
files: :file:`ONEINT`, :file:`ORDINT`, :file:`RUNFILE`, :file:`INPORB`,
:file:`JOBIPH`
(for more information see :numref:`UG:sec:files_list`).

A number of additional files generated by :program:`SEWARD` are also used by the
:program:`RASSCF` program.
The availability of either of the files named :file:`INPORB` and
:file:`JOBOLD` is optional and determined by the input options
LUMORB and JOBIPH, respectively.

Output files
............

.. class:: filelist

:file:`JOBIPH`
  This file is written in binary format and carries the results
  of the wave function optimization such as MO- and CI-coefficients.
  If several consecutive RASSCF calculations are made, the file names will
  be modified by appending "01","02", etc.

:file:`RUNFILE`
  The :file:`RUNFILE` is updated with information from the RASSCF calculation
  such as the first order density and the Fock matrix.

:file:`MD_CAS.x`
  Molden input file for molecular orbital analysis for CI root x.

:file:`RASORB`
  This ASCII file contains molecular orbitals, occupation numbers, and
  orbital indices from a :program:`RASSCF` calculation. The natural orbitals
  of individual states in an average-state calculation are also produced,
  and are named :file:`RASORB.1`, :file:`RASORB.2`, etc.

:file:`MCDENS`
  This ASCII file is generated for MC-PDFT calculations.
  It contains spin densities, total density and on-top pair density values on grid (coordinates in a.u.).

.. _UG\:sec\:rasscf_inp:

Input
-----

This section describes the input to the
:program:`RASSCF` program in the |molcas| program system. The input starts
with the program name ::

  &RASSCF

There are no compulsory keywords, but almost any meaningful calculation
will require some keyword. At the same time, most choices have default
settings, and many are able to take relevant values from earlier
calculations, from available orbital files, etc.

To run an MC-PDFT calculation in the :program:`RASSCF` module, the keywords :kword:`CIONLY`, :kword:`KSDFT`,
:kword:`ROKS` and the functional choice are needed. The currently available functionals are tPBE,
tBLYP and tLSDA. Also: :kword:`LUMORB` is needed if external orbitals are used.
:kword:`JOBIPH` is needed if external orbital stored in :file:`JobIph` files are used.
:kword:`CIRESTART` is needed if a pre-optimized CI vector stored in :file:`JOBIPH` is to be used.

Optional keywords
.................

There is a large number of optional keywords you can specify. They are
used to specify the orbital spaces, the CI wave function etc., but also
more arcane technical details that can modify e.g. the convergence or
precision. The first 4 characters of the keyword are recognized by the
input parser and the rest is ignored. If not otherwise stated the numerical

:kword:`CLEAnup`
  This input is used to set to zero specific coefficients of the input
  orbitals. It is of value, for example, when the actual symmetry is
  higher than given by input and the trial orbitals are contaminated
  by lower symmetry mixing. The input requires at least one line
  per symmetry specifying the number of additional groups of orbitals
  to clean. For each group of orbitals within the symmetry, three lines
  follow. The first line indicates the number of considered orbitals
  and the specific number of the orbital (within the symmetry) in the
  set of input orbitals. Note the input lines can not be longer than 72
  characters and the program expects as many continuation lines as are
  needed. The second line indicates the number of
  coefficients belonging to the prior orbitals which are going to be
  set to zero and which coefficients. The third line indicates the
  number of the coefficients of all the complementary orbitals of
  the symmetry which are going to be set to zero and which are these
  coefficients. Here is an example of what an input would look like: ::

    CLEAnup
    2
       3 4 7 9; 3 10 11 13; 4 12 15 16 17
       2 8 11; 1 15; 0
    0; 0; 0

  In this example the first entry indicates that two groups of orbitals are
  specified in the first symmetry. The first item of the
  following entry indicates that there are three orbitals considered
  (4, 7, and 9). The first item of the following entry indicates that there
  are three coefficients of the orbitals 4, 7, and 9 to be set to zero,
  coefficients 10, 11, and 13. The first item of the following entry indicates
  that there are four coefficients (12, 15, 16, and 17) which will be zero
  in all the remaining orbitals of the symmetry. For the second group of
  the first symmetry orbitals 8 and 11 will have their coefficient 15 set
  to zero, while nothing will be applied in the remaining orbitals.
  If a geometry optimization is performed the keyword is inactive after
  the first structure iteration.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: CLEAnup <advanced>
              This input is used to set to zero specific coefficients of the input
              orbitals. The option is, for instance, of great value if the symmetry of a
              molecule is higher than given by input and hence the trial orbitals are
              contaminated by components of lower symmetry. The restrictions are
              introduced by grouping orbitals of the same symmetry into additional
              classes. Orbitals belonging to a given classes are requested to obey a set
              of rules. In addition, all orbitals not belonging to that class, can be
              requested to obey another set of rules. Here, a rule is defined as being
              identical to the instruction: set coefficient i in orbital j to zero.

              The keyword requires at least one line of input per symmetry specifying
              the number of additional classes in this symmetry (a 0 (zero) denotes that
              there is no additional classes). If the number of additional classes is not
              zero then the program expects for each classes three lines of input: The
              first entry includes as first datum the dimension of the class followed by
              the list of orbitals included in this class. The second entry defines the
              set of rules which are applied to all orbitals within the class. The first
              datum defines the number of MO-coefficients to be set to zero and is
              followed by a list of which coefficients are to be touched. Finally, the
              third entry of input define the set of rules to be applied to all orbital
              not belonging to the class. Here too, the first value defines the number of
              MO-coefficients to be set to zero and is followed by a list of which
              coefficients are to be touched.

:kword:`SUPSym`
  This input is used to restrict possible orbital
  rotations. It is of value, for example, when the actual symmetry is
  higher than given by input. Each orbital is given a label IXSYM(I).
  If two orbitals in the same symmetry have different labels they will
  not be allowed to rotate into each other and thus prevents from obtaining
  symmetry broken solutions. Note, however, that the starting orbitals must
  have the right symmetry. The input requires one or more entries
  per symmetry. The first specifies the number of additional subgroups in this
  symmetry (a 0 (zero) denotes that there is no additional subgroups and the
  value of IXSYM will be 0 (zero) for all orbitals in that symmetry ).
  If the number of additional subgroups is not zero there are additional
  entries for each subgroup: The dimension of the subgroup and
  the list of orbitals in the subgroup counted relative to the first orbital
  in this symmetry. Note, the input lines can not be longer than 180 characters
  and the program expects continuation lines as many as there are needed.
  As an example assume an atom treated in :math:`C_{2v}` symmetry for
  which the d\ :math:`_{z^2}` orbitals (7 and 10) in symmetries 1 may mix with the
  s orbitals. In addition, the d\ :math:`_{z^2}` and d\ :math:`_{x^2-y^2}` orbitals (8 and 11)
  may also mix. Then the input would look like:

  .. If the number of additional subgroups is not zero then the
     program expects for each subgroup at least one additional entry of which
     the first number denotes the dimension of the subgroup (number of
     orbitals involved) followed by the orbital index relative to the first
     orbital in this symmetry.

  ::

    SUPSym
    2
       2 7 10; 2 8 11
    0; 0; 0

  In this example the first entry indicates that we would like to specify
  two additional subgroups in the first symmetry (total symmetric group). The
  first item in the following two entries declares that each subgroup consists
  of two orbitals. Orbitals 7 and 10 constitute the first group and it is
  assumed that these are orbitals of d\ :math:`_{z^2}` character. The second group
  includes the d\ :math:`_{x^2-y^2}` orbitals 8 and 11. The following three entries
  denote that there are no further subgroups defined for the remaining
  symmetries. Ordering of the orbitals according to energy is deactivated
  when using :kword:`SUPSym`. If you activate ordering using :kword:`ORDEr`,
  the new labels will be printed in the output section.
  If a geometry optimization is performed the reordered matrix will be stored
  in the :file:`RUNFILE` file and read from there instead of from the input
  in each new structure iteration.

  and 5=Insane. If input is not given, the default (normally=2) is determined
  by a global setting which can be altered bubroutine call.
  (Programmers: See programming guide). The local print level in any section is
  the maximum of the IPRGLB and IPRSEC() setting, and is automatically reduced
  e.g. during structure optimizations or numerical differentiation. Example: ::

              </KEYWORD>

:kword:`OUTOrbitals`
  This keyword is used to select the type of orbitals to be written
  in a formated ASCII file. By default a formated :file:`RASORB` file
  containing average orbitals and subsequent :file:`RASORB.1`,
  :file:`RASORB.2`, etc., files containing natural orbitals for each
  of the computed (up to ten) roots will be generated in the working directory.
  An entry follows with an additional keyword selecting the orbital type.
  The possibilities are:

  AVERage orbitals: this is the default option.
  This keyword is used to produce a formated ASCII file of orbitals
  (:file:`RASORB`) which correspond to the final state average density matrix obtained by
  the :program:`RASSCF` program. The inactive and
  secondary orbitals have been transformed to make an effective Fock
  matrix diagonal. Corresponding diagonal elements are given as orbital
  energies in the :program:`RASSCF` output listing. The active orbitals have been
  obtained by diagonalizing the sub-blocks of the average density matrix
  corresponding to the three different RAS orbital spaces, thereby
  the name pseudo-natural orbitals. They will be true natural orbitals
  only for a CASSCF wave function.

  CANOnical orbitals:
  Use this keyword to produce the canonical orbitals. They differ from
  the natural orbitals, because also the active part of the Fock matrix is
  diagonalized. Note that the density matrix is no longer diagonal and
  the CI coefficients have not been transformed to this basis.
  This option substitutes the previous keyword :kword:`CANOnical`.

  NATUral orbitals:
  Use this keyword to produce the true natural orbitals. The keyword
  should be followed by a new line with an integer specifying the maximum
  CI root for which the orbitals and occupation numbers are needed.
  One file for each root will be generated up to the specified number.
  In a one state RASSCF calculation this number is always 1, but if an average
  calculation has been performed, the NO's can be obtained for all the states
  included in the energy averaging. Note that the natural orbitals main
  use is as input for property calculations using :program:`SEWARD`.
  The files will be named :file:`RASORB`, :file:`RASORB.2`, :file:`RASORB.3`, etc.
  This keyword is on by default for up to ten roots.

  SPIN orbitals.
  This keyword is used to produce a set of spin orbitals and is
  followed by a new line with an integer specifying the maximum CI root
  for which the orbitals
  and occupation numbers are needed. One file for each root will be
  generated up to the specified number. Note, for convenience the
  doubly occupied and secondary orbitals have been added to these
  sets with occupation numbers 0 (zero). The main use of these orbitals
  is to act as input to property calculations and for graphical
  presentations.
  This keyword is on by default for up to ten roots.

  An example input follows in which five files are requested containing
  natural orbitals for roots one to five of a RASSCF calculation.
  The files are named :file:`RASORB.1`, :file:`RASORB.2`, :file:`RASORB.3`, :file:`RASORB.4`, and :file:`RASORB.5`,
  respectively for each one of the roots.
  Although this is the default, it can be used complemented by the :kword:`ORBOnly`
  keyword, and the orbitals will be read from
  a JobIph file from a previous calculation, in case the formated files
  were lost or you require more than ten roots. As an option the
  :kword:`MAXOrb` can be also used to increase the number of files
  over ten. ::

A general comment concerning the input orbitals: The orbitals are ordered by
symmetry. Within each symmetry block the order is assumed to be:
frozen, inactive, active, external (secondary), and deleted. Note that
if the :kword:`Spdelete` option has been used in a preceding
:program:`SCF` calculation, the deleted orbitals will automatically be placed as
the last ones in each symmetry block.

For calculations of a molecule in a reaction field see :numref:`UG:sec:rfield`
of the present manual and :numref:`TUT:sec:cavity` of the examples manual.

Input example
.............

The following example shows the input to the
:program:`RASSCF` program for a calculation on the water molecule. The calculation is
performed in :math:`C_{2v}` symmetry (symmetries: :math:`a_1`, :math:`b_2`, :math:`b_1`, :math:`a_2`, where the two
last species are antisymmetric with respect to the molecular plane). Inactive
orbitals are :math:`1a_1` (oxygen 1s) :math:`2a_1` (oxygen 2s) and
:math:`1b_1` (the :math:`\pi` lone-pair orbital). Two bonding and two anti-bonding
OH orbitals are active, :math:`a_1` and :math:`b_2` symmetries. The calculation is
performed for the :math:`^1A_1` ground state. Note that no information about basis set,
geometry, etc. has to be given. Such information is supplied by the
:program:`SEWARD` integral program via the one-electron integral file :file:`ONEINT`. ::

  Title= Water molecule. Active orbitals OH and OH* in both symmetries
  Spin     = 1
  Symmetry = 1
  Inactive = 2 0 1 0
  Ras2     = 2 2 0 0

The following input is an example of how to use the RASSCF program to run MC-PDFT calculations: ::

  &RASSCF

  Ras2
  1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
  KSDFT
  ROKS
  TPBE

The first RASSCF run is a standard CASSCF calculation that leads to variationally optimized orbitals and CI coefficients.
The second call to the RASSCF input will use the CI vector and the orbitals previously optimized. The second RASSCF will
require the :kword:`CIONLY` keyword as the MC-PDFT is currently not compatible with SCF. :kword:`KSDFT` :kword:`ROKS` and the functional choice will
provide MC-PDFT energies.

More advanced examples can be found in the tutorial section of the manual.

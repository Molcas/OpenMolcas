            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The GUGADRT program generates distict row table
            used by the MRCI. The program was written
            by Yubin Wang and Bingbing Suo,
            and has since been slightly modified to fit MOLCAS.
            </HELP>

The :program:`GUGADRT` program generates distict row table (DRT)
used in the :program:`GUGACI`
in :index:`Direct CI` calculations :cite:`Roos:72`.
Only DRT in active space are generated because
the hole-particle symmetry is used in :program:`GUGACI` :cite:`YBWang:1,BSuo:1`.
These DRT are used to evaluated the coupling coefficients
by the :index:`Graphical Unitary
Group Approach` :cite:`Shavitt:77,Shavitt:78,Siegbahn:80`,
for wavefunctions with at most two electrons excited from a set of
reference configurations. The reference configurations can be specified as a
list, where the occupation numbers are given for each active orbital
(see below) in each reference configuration, or as a :index:`Full CI`
within
the space defined by the active orbitals. In the :program:`GUGADRT` and :program:`GUGACI`
the orbitals are classified as follows:
Frozen, Inactive, Active, Secondary, and Deleted orbitals. Within each
symmetry type, they follow this order. For the :program:`GUGADRT` program,
only the active orbitals are relevant.

* **Inactive:** :index:`Inactive orbitals <single: GUGADRT; Inactive>` are doubly occupied
  in all reference configurations, but excitations out of this orbital
  space are allowed in the final CI wavefunction, i.e., they are
  correlated but have two electrons in all *reference* configurations.
  Since only single and double excitations are allowed, there can be no
  more than two holes in the active orbitals.

* **Active:** :index:`Active orbitals <single: GUGADRT; Active>` are those which may have
  different occupation in different reference configurations.

Formally, there are no compulsory keyword. Obviously, some
input must be given for a meaningful calculation.

:kword:`TITLe`
  The lines following this keyword are treated as title lines, until
  another keyword is encountered.

  The spin degeneracy number, i.e. 2S+1. The value is read from the
  line following the keyword, in free format. The default value is
  1, meaning a singlet wave function.

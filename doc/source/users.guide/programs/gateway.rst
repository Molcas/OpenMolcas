            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The Gateway module collects information about molecular
            system (geometry, basis sets, symmetry) to be used for future calculations.
            Note that there are two input styles - the old style format and the new XYZ format.
            The input can also contain an embedded reaction field input (starts with the
            "RF-input" keyword and terminates with the "End of RF-input" keyword). Keywords below
            carrying a "(RF)" are associated with that embedded RF-input section.
            Gateway also controls options associated with auxiliary basis sets to be used
            in density fitting procedures.
            </HELP>

The Gateway module collects information about molecular
system (geometry, basis sets, symmetry) to be used for future calculations.

Gateway module is a subset of :program:`seward`. All keywords
for this module can also appear as an input for :program:`SEWARD`, however,
for clearity the information about molecular system can be placed
as an input for this module. Note, that gateway module does not
compute any integral, and so must be followed by run of :program:`SEWARD`
module.

:program:`GATEWAY` destroys the communication file :file:`RUNFILE`,
if it is used in a combination with geometry optimization it should run
outside the optimization loop.

Input
-----

This sections will describe the various possible input blocks in :program:`Gateway`.
These control

* the molecular structure (coordinates, symmetry and basis sets),
* explicit auxiliary basis sets in terms of CD basis sets (aCD and acCD) or
  external auxiliary basis sets,
* parameters for reaction field calculations, i.e. parameters for the Kirkwood model
  or the PCM model and options for Pauli repulsion integral and external field integrals,
* options for finite nuclear charge distribution models in association with relativistic calculations, and
* the option to use the Saddle method to locate transitions state geometries.

The :program:`Gateway` input section always starts with the program reference: ::

  isotopes or arbitrary masses can be chosen. The keyword is followed by the number
  :math:`n` of isotopic specifications, and then by :math:`n` lines. Each of these
  lines should contain the symmetry-unique index of the atom for which the default
  mass is to be modified and either the mass number of the desired isotope (tabulated
  masses for most known isotopes are available in the code, use ``0`` for the default
  isotope) or the desired mass in dalton, in the latter case the keyword :kword:`Dalton`
  should follow. Note that all atoms belonging to the same "center type" must have the
  same mass. This usually means all atoms of a given element with the same basis set.
  If more fine-grained specifications are wanted, additional center types must be
  created by using several :kword:`BASIs Set` blocks for the same element (native
  input) or by using labels (XYZ input).

Molecular structure: coordinates, symmetry and basis sets
.........................................................

There are three different ways to specify the molecular structure, symmetry and
the basis sets in :program:`Gateway`:

* the so-called native input (old |molcas| standard),
* XYZ input.

.. * XYZ input, and
   * Z-matrix input.

Note that only XYZ input for :program:`Gateway` is supported by Graphical User interface.
:program:`Gateway` makes a decision about the type of the input based on keywords.
If :kword:`Coord` is used, it assumes that the input is in XYZ format.

.. , if :kword:`ZMAT` is used,
   it assumes Z-matrix input.

The three different modes will be described below.

Native input
::::::::::::

If the geometry is specified in a native |molcas| format, only symmetry
inequivalent atoms should be specified. The default units are atomic units.
By default, symmetry is not used in the calculation.

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`SYMMetry`
  Symmetry specification follows on next line. There may be up to
  three different point group generators specified on that line. The
  generators of a point group is the minimal set of symmetry operators
  which is needed to generate all symmetry
  operators of a specific point group. A generator is in the input
  represented as a sequence of up to three of the characters x, y, and
  z. The order within a given sequence is arbitrary and the generators
  can be given in any sequence. Observe that the order of the irreps
  is defined by the order of the generators as
  (:math:`E`, :math:`g_1`, :math:`g_2`, :math:`g_1g_2`, :math:`g_3`, :math:`g_1g_3`, :math:`g_2g_3`,
  :math:`g_1g_2g_3`)! Note that :math:`E` is always assumed and should never
  be specified.

  Below is listed the possible generators.

  * **x** --- Reflection in the :math:`yz`-plane.
  * **y** --- Reflection in the :math:`xz`-plane.
  * **z** --- Reflection in the :math:`xy`-plane.
  * **xy** --- Twofold rotation around the :math:`z`-axis.
  * **xz** --- Twofold rotation around the :math:`y`-axis.
  * **yz** --- Twofold rotation around the :math:`x`-axis.
  * **xyz** --- Inversion through the origin.

  The default is no symmetry.

  .. xmldoc:: <KEYWORD MODULE="GATEWAY" NAME="SYMMETRY" APPEAR="Symmetry" KIND="STRING" LEVEL="BASIC" EXCLUSIVE="COORD">
              %%Keyword: Symmetry (non-XYZ format) <basic>
              Symmetry point group is specified by up to three group generators.
              Possible generators are "x", "y", "z", "xy", "xz", "yz", and "xyz".
              The order of the irreps depends on the order of the generators.
              The keyword can be used only in 'native' input format.
              </KEYWORD>

:kword:`BASIs Set`
  This notes the start of a basis set definition.
  The next line always contains a basis set label.
  The basis set definition is alway terminated with the "End of Basis" keyword.
  For the definitions of basis set labels see the subsequent sections.
  Below follows a description of the options associated with the
  basis set definition.

  .. xmldoc:: <KEYWORD MODULE="GATEWAY" NAME="BASIS (NATIVE)" APPEAR="Basis set" KIND="CUSTOM" LEVEL="BASIC" INPUT="REQUIRED" EXCLUSIVE="COORD">
              %%Keyword: BASIS (non-XYZ format) <basic>
              This notes the start of a basis set definition.
              The next line always contains a basis set label.
              The basis set definition is alway terminated with the "End of Basis" keyword.
              For details consult the manual.
              </KEYWORD>

  * **Label [/ option]** ---
    The label is a specification of a specific basis set, e.g.
    C.ANO...4s3p2d., which is an ANO basis set.
    If no option is specified
    :program:`GATEWAY` will look for the basis
    set in the default basis directory. If an option is specified it
    could either be the name of an alternative basis directory or
    the wording "Inline" which defines
    that the basis set will follow in the current input
    file. For the format of the
    **Inline** option see the section
    "Basis set format". Observe that the label is arbitrary for this
    option and will not be decoded.
    The **Label** card is mandatory.

  * **Name x, y, z (Angstrom or Bohr)** ---
    This card specifies an arbitrary (see next sentence!) name
    for a symmetry distinct center and its Cartesian coordinates.
    Observe, that the
    name "DBAS" is restricted to assign the center of the
    diffuse basis functions required to model the continuum
    orbitals in R-matrix calculations.
    The label is truncated to four characters. Observe that this
    label must be unique to each center. The coordinate unit can
    be specified as an option. The default unit is Bohr.
    There should at least be one card of this type in a basis set
    definition.

  * **Charge** ---
    The real entry on the subsequent line defines
    the charge associated with
    this basis set. This will override the default which is defined in
    the basis set library. The option can be used to put in ghost
    orbitals as well as to augment the basis sets of the library.
    The **Charge** card is optional.

    .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Charge (non-XYZ format) <advanced>
                The real entry on the subsequent line defines
                the charge associated with
                this basis set. This will override the default which is defined in
                the basis set library. The option can be used to put in ghost
                orbitals as well as to augment the basis sets of the library.
                The "Charger" card is optional.

  * **Spherical** [option] ---
    Specifying which shells will be in real spherical Gaussians. Valid options
    are "all" or a list of the shell characters separated by a blank. The
    shell characters are s, p, d, f, etc. All shells after p are by
    default in real spherical Gaussians, except for the d-functions in the
    6-31G family of basis sets which are in Cartesian.
    The **Spherical** card is optional. The s and p shells and the d-functions of
    the 6-31G family of basis sets are by default in Cartesian Gaussians.

    .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Spherical (non-XYZ format) <advanced>
                Specifying which shells will be in real spherical Gaussians. Valid options
                are "all" or a list of the shell characters separated by a blank. The
                shell characters are s, p, d, f, etc. All shells after p are by
                default in real spherical Gaussians, except for the d-functions in the
                6-31G family of basis sets which are in Cartesian.
                The "Spherical" card is optional. The s and p shells and the d-functions of
                the 6-31G family of basis sets are by default in Cartesian Gaussians.

  * **Cartesian** [option] ---
    Specifying which shells will be in a Cartesian Gaussian representation. For syntax
    consult the corresponding **Spherical** keyword.

    .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Cartesian (non-XYZ format) <advanced>
                Specifying which shells will be in a Cartesian Gaussian representation. For syntax
                consult the corresponding Spherical keyword.

  * **Contaminant** [option] ---
    Specifying for which shells the contaminant will be kept.
    The contaminants are functions of lower rank which are generated
    when a Cartesian shell is transformed to a spherical representation
    (e.g. :math:`r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2` for d-shells, p contaminants for f-shells,
    s and d contaminants for g-shells, etc.).
    Valid options are the same as for the **Spherical** keyword.
    The default is no contaminant in any shell. The **Contaminant** card is optional.

    .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Contaminant (non-XYZ format) <advanced>
                Specifying for which shells the contaminant will be kept.
                The contaminants are functions of lower rank which are generated
                when a Cartesian shell is transformed to a spherical representation
                (e.g. r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2 for d-shells, p contaminants for f-shells,
                s and d contaminants for g-shells, etc.).
                Valid options are the same as for the Spherical keyword.
                The default is no contaminant in any shell. The "Contaminant" card is optional.

  * **Muon** ---
    Specifying that the basis set is muonic.

    .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Muon (non-XYZ format) <advanced>
                Specifying that the basis set is muonic.

  * **End of Basis set** ---
    Marks the end of the basis set specification.
    This card is mandatory.

    .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: End of Basis set (non-XYZ format) <advanced>
                Marks the end of the basis set specification.
                This card is mandatory.

Z-matrix and XYZ input
::::::::::::::::::::::

Some times it is more convenient to set up information about coordinates in
a standard form of Z-matrix or Cartesian coordinates. In this case,
the basis set for the atoms should be specified after the :kword:`XBAS`
keyword. After that either :kword:`ZMAT` or :kword:`XYZ` should appear
to specify the coordinates.
Note that coordinates in these formats use ångström as units.

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`XBAS`
  A keyword to specify the basis for atoms. The specification is very similar
  to the native format: ``ATOM.BasisSet``. Each new atom is written at a new line.
  The end of the keyword is marked by an :kword:`End of basis` line.

  If all atoms have the same basis, e.g. ANO-S-VDZ, it is possible to use
  this name without element name. In this case there is no need to specify
  :kword:`End of basis`.

  .. compound::

    Example: ::

      XBAS=STO-3G

    or ::

      XBAS
      C.STO-3G
      H.STO-3G
      End of basis

              The end of the keyword is marked by an 'End of basis' line.

              'End of basis'.
              </KEYWORD>

:kword:`ZMAT`
  Alternative format to give coordinates in terms of bond lengths,
  bond angles, and dihedral angles.
  Each line of a Z-matrix gives the
  internal coordinates for one of the atoms within the molecule with the following
  syntax:

  .. container:: list

    **Name  I bond-length  J bond-angle  K dihedral-angle**

    **Name** is the label (atomic symbol + string) for a symmetry distinct center L;

    **I bond-length** distance of L from atom I;

    **J bond-angle** planar angle between atoms L--I--J;

    **K dihedral-angle** dihedral angle between atoms L--I--J--K.

  Note that the first atom only requires the **Name** and defines the origin of
  Cartesian axis.
  The second atom requires **Name  I bond-length** and it will define the Z axis.
  The third atom requires **Name  I bond-length  J bond-angle** and defines the
  XZ plane (and implicitly, the Y axis).

  Only numerical values must be used (no variable names) and ångströms
  and degrees are assumed as units.

  Two types of special atoms are allowed: *dummy* **X** atoms and
  *ghost* **Z** atoms. The former will appear in the calculations,
  they have a nuclear charge of 0 and have not electrons and Basis Set.
  They will also appear in the definition of internal coordinates in :program:`SLAPAF`.
  The latter are used only within the Z-Matrix definition of the geometry but
  they will appear in the final Z-matrix section in :program:`SLAPAF`.
  Both special atoms can be used to define the Cartesian axis and the symmetry elements.

  **End of ZMAT** or a blank line mark the end of the section.

  In geometry optimizations, :program:`SLAPAF` will regenerate the coordinates as
  Z-matrix in the section with the summary concerning each iteration. This will
  be possible only if *ghost* atoms are used within the first three atoms or
  if they are not used at all.

  Both :kword:`BASIs` and :kword:`ZMAT` keywords can be used at the same time. Here is an example
  for a complex between methanol and water (:math:`C_s` symmetry): ::

    Symmetry
     Y
    XBAS
    H.ANO-L...1s.
    C.ANO-L...2s1p.
    O.ANO-L...2s1p.
    End of basis
    ZMAT
    C1
    O2  1 1.3350
    H3  1 1.0890  2 109.471
    H4  1 1.0890  2 109.471  3 -120.
    H6  2 1.0890  1 109.471  3  180.
    End of z-matrix
    Basis set
    O.ANO-L...2s1p.

     H    -2.748759     0.819593     2.808729  / Angstrom
    End of basis

  In this case :program:`SLAPAF` will not regenerate the Z-matrix.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: ZMAT <basic>
              Alternative format to give coordinates in the form of Z-matrix.
              Only numerical values must be used (no variable names) and angstroms
              and degrees are assumed as units. Special ghost Z and dummy X atoms
              are allowed. 'End of ZMAT' or a blank line marks the end of the section.

:kword:`XYZ`
  The keyword is followed by XYZ formatted file (a reference to a file),
  or file, inlined into the input.

  .. compound::

    Example: ::

      XBAS=STO-3G
      XYZ=$CurrDir/Water.xyz

    or ::

      XBAS=STO-3G
      XYZ
      1
       note Angstrom units!
      C 0 0 0

  Currently, the :kword:`XYZ` keyword does not operate with symmetry, and
  the calculation is always performed without symmetry.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: XYZ <basic>
              Alternative format to set up geometry as XYZ formatted file

Advanced XYZ input
::::::::::::::::::

If the geometry is specified in XYZ format, all atoms should be specified.
The default units are Ångströms. By default, maximum possible symmetry is used.

"Molcas XYZ" file format is an extension of plain XYZ format.

* First line of this file contains the number of atoms.

* Second line (a comment line) can contain "a.u." or "bohr" to
  use atomic units, instead of default Ångströms.
  Also this line can contain keyword TRANS, followed by 3 numbers,
  and/or ROT, followed by 9 numbers (in this case coordinates
  will be Translated by specified vector, and/or Rotated), and SCALE (or
  SCALEX, SCALEY, SCALEZ) followed by a scale factor.

* Remaining lines are used to specify Element and cartesian
  coordinates.

  Element name might be optionally followed by a Number (e.g. ``H7``),
  a Label (separated by ``_`` sign: e.g. ``H_INNER``), or Basis Set (separated by ``.``,
  e.g. ``H.STO-3G``)

.. class:: keywordlist

:kword:`COORD`
  The keyword followed on the next line by the name of an HDF5 (created by any module), or the name of an XYZ file,
  or inline coordinates in XYZ format. If the file is located in the same directory, where
  |molcas| job was submitted there is no need to specify the PATH to this file.
  The keyword may appear several times. In this case all coordinate files
  will be concatenated, and considered as individual fragments.

:kword:`BASIS`
  The keyword can be used to specify global basis set for all atoms, or for a group of atoms.
  The keyword followed by a label of basis set, or by comma separated list of basis sets for
  individual atoms.

  Note! The basis set definition in XYZ mode does not allow to use
  inline basis set.

  Example: ::

    BASIS
    STO-3G, H.6-31G*

  In this example, the C atom (in the origin) will have the basis set STO-3G and
  the H atoms 6-31G*.

  * NOSYM (same as E, or C1)
  * space separated list of generators: e.g. X XY (for more details see SYMMETRY keyword)

If XYZ input has been used in :program:`gateway`, a file with native |molcas| input will be
produced and stored in working directory under the name :file:`findsym.std`.

Note that choosing XYZ input you are expecting that the coordinates might be transformed.
It can be shown by the following example: ::

  &gateway
  coord
  3

  O 0 0 0
  H 1.0000001 0 0
  H 0 1 0.0000001
  *nomove
  *group=c1

The geometry of the molecule is slightly distorted, but within a threshold it is :math:`C_{2v}`.
Thus by default (keywords :kword:`nomove` and :kword:`group` are not active), the
coordinates will be transformed to maintain the highest possible symmetry.
If keyword :kword:`nomove` is active, the molecule is not allowed to rotate, and
a mirror plane :math:`xy` is the only symmetry element. Since the third hydrogen atom is
slightly out of this plane, it will be corrected. Only activation of the keyword :kword:`group=C1`
will ensure that the geometry is unchanged.

    BASIS
    STO-3G

  or, in short EMIL notation: ::

    &GATEWAY
    COORD=water.xyz; BASIS=STO-3G

Coordinate file may contain variables, as demonstrated in an example: ::

The atom name in XYZ file can contain an orbitrary label (to simplify assigning of different
basis sets). To indicate the label, use ``_``: e.g. ``C_SMALL``. The same label should be
defined in the basis section: ``BASIS=C_SMALL.ANO-S-MB``. The basis set label can be also
added into the name of an element: ::

  COORD
  1

  O.ANO-S-VDZP 0 0 0

XYZ file can also contain information about point charges. There are three possibilities to
setup atomic charges in XYZ file. The main option is to use ``Q`` as an element name, and in this
case the forth number, the charge, should be specified. Another possibility is to use element
names ended with minus sign. In this case, a formal charge for the element will be used.
E.g. ``H-``, ``Li-``, ``Na-``, ``K-`` defines :math:`+1` charge located in the corresponding location.
``Mg-``, ``Ca-`` --- defines charge :math:`+2`, ``Al-`` --- :math:`+3`, ``C-``, ``Si-`` :math:`+4`, for anions, ``F-``, ``Cl-``, ``Br-``, ``I-`` defines :math:`-1`,
``O-``, ``S-`` --- :math:`-2`. Finally, a label at the comment line of XYZ file --- CLUSTER followed by
an integer number can specify how many atoms are "real", so the rest will be treated as
charges with default values for this element.

Explicit auxiliary basis sets
.............................

The so-called Resolution of Identity (RI) technique (also called Density
Fitting, DF) is implemented in the |molcas| package. This option involves the use
of an auxiliary basis set in the effective computation of the 2-electron
integrals. |molcas| incorporates both the use of conventionally computed,
externally provided, auxiliary basis sets (RIJ, RIJK, and RIC types), and
on-the-fly generated auxiliary basis sets. The latter are atomic CD (aCD) or the
atomic compact CD (acCD) basis
sets, based on the Cholesky decomposition method. The externally provided
auxiliary basis sets are very compact, since they are tailored for special
wave function methods. However, they are not provided for all available valence
basis sets. The aCD or acCD RI auxiliary basis sets are a more general option and
provides auxiliary basis sets for any wave function model and valence basis set.

Reaction field calculations
...........................

The effect of the solvent on the quantum chemical calculations has been
introduced in |molcas| through the reaction field created
by the surrounding environment, represented by a polarizable dielectric
continuum outside the boundaries of a cavity containing the solute molecule.
|molcas| supports Self Consistent Reaction Field (SCRF) and Multi
Configurational Self Consistent Reaction Field (MCSCRF) calculations within
the framework of the :program:`SCF` and the :program:`RASSCF` programs.
The reaction field, computed in a self-consistent fashion, can be
later added as a constant perturbation for the remaining programs, as
for example :program:`CASPT2`.

The purpose of this facility is to incorporate
the effect of the environment (a solvent or a solid matrix) on the studied molecule.
The utility itself it is not a program, but requires
an additional input which has to be provided to the
:program:`GATEWAY` program.
Two methods are available for SCRF calculations: one is based on the Kirkwood
model, the other is the so called Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM).
The reaction field is computed as the response of a dielectric medium polarized
by the solute molecule: the solute is placed in a "cavity" surrounded by the
dielectric. In Kirkwood model the cavity is always spherical, whereas in PCM the
cavity is modeled on the actual solute shape.

The possible set of parameters controlled by input are:

* the Kirkwood model,
* the PCM model, and
* one-electron integrals representing
  Pauli repulsion and external fields.

First a brief presentation of the Kirkwood and the PCM models.

.. index::
   single: Kirkwood model

The Kirkwood Model
::::::::::::::::::

The Kirkwood model is an expansion of the so-called Onsager model where
the surrounding will be characterized by its dielectric
permitivity and a radius describing a spherical cavity,
indicating where the dielectric medium starts.
(Note that all atoms in the studied molecule must be inside the spherical cavity.) The Pauli repulsion
due to the medium can be introduced by use of the spherical well
integrals which are generated by :program:`SEWARD`.
The charge distribution of the molecule will introduce
an electric field acting on the dielectric medium. This reaction field will interact with the
charge distribution of the molecule. This interaction will manifest itself as
a perturbation to the one-electron Hamiltonian. The perturbation will be
automatically computed in a direct fashion (no multipole integrals are stored on
disk) and added to the one-electron Hamiltonian. Due to the direct way in which
this contribution is computed rather high terms in the multipole expansion of the
charge can be afforded.

.. index::
   single: PCM

The Polarizable Continuum Model, PCM
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The PCM has been developed in order to describe the solvent reaction field in a
more realistic way, basically through the use of cavities of general shape, modeled on the
solute. The cavity is built as the envelope of spheres centered on solute atoms or atomic
groups (usually, hydrogen atoms are included in the same sphere as the heavy atoms they are
bonded to). The reaction field is described by means of apparent charges (solvation
charges) spread on the cavity surface, designed to reproduced the electrostatic potential
due to the polarized dielectric inside the cavity.
Such charges are used both to compute solute-solvent interactions (modifying the total energy
of the solute), and to perturb the molecular Hamiltonian through a suitable operator
(thus distorcing the solute wave-function, and affecting all the electronic properties).
The PCM operator contains both one- and two-electron terms: it is computed using
atomic integrals already present in the program, through a "geometry matrix"
connecting different points lying on the cavity surface. It can be shown that
with this approach the SCF and RASSCF variational procedures lead to the
free energy of the given molecule in solution: this is the thermodynamic meaning
of the SCF or CI energy provided by the program. More precisely, this is the
solute-solvent electrostatic contribution to the free energy
(of course, other terms depending on solute atomic motions, like vibrational and
rotational free energies, should be included separately);
it can be used to get a good
approximation of the solvation free energy, by subtracting the SCF or CI energy
computed in vacuo, and also to compute directly energy surfaces and reaction paths
in solution. On the other hand, the solute wave-function perturbed by the
reaction field can be used to compute any electronic property in solution.

Also other quantities can be computed, namely the cavitation free energy (due
the the work spent to create the cavity in the dielectric) and the
dispersion-repulsion free energy: these terms affect only the total free energy of the molecule,
and not its electronic distribution. They are collectively referred to as
non-electrostatic contributions.

Note that two other keywords are defined for the :program:`RASSCF`
program:
they refer to the CI root selected for the calculation of the reaction field (RFROOT), and
to the possibility to perform a non-equilibrium calculation (NONEQ) when vertical electronic
transitions are studied in solution. These keywords are referenced in the
:program:`RASSCF` section. To include the reaction field perturbation in a :program:`SCF`, :program:`RASSCF`, :program:`CASPT2` or :program:`RASSI`
calculation, another keyword must be specified (RFPERT), as explained in the
respective program sections.

Complete and detailed examples of how to add a reaction field,
through the Kirkwood or the PCM model, into quantum chemical
calculations in |molcas| is presented in section :ref:`TUT:sec:cavity` of the
examples manual. The user is encouraged to read that section for further details.

:kword:`XFIEld integrals`
  Request the presence of an external electric field represented by a
  number of partial charges and dipoles. Optionally, polarisabilities may be specified whose
  induced dipoles are determined self-consistently during the SCF iteration.
  The first line may contain, apart from the first integer [nXF] (number of centers), up to
  four additional integers. The second integer [nOrd] specifies the maximum multipole order,
  or -1 signifying no permanent multipoles. Default is 1 (charges and dipoles). The third
  integer [p] specifies the type of external polarisabilities: 0 (default) no polarisabilities,
  1 (isotropic), or 2 (anisotropic). The fourth integer [nFrag] specifies the number of fragments one
  multipole may contribute to (relevant only if polarisabilities are present). The default is 0,
  meaning that each permanent multipole is only excluded in the calculation of the field at its own
  polarisability, 1 means that one gives a fragment number to each multipole and that the static
  multipoles do not contribute to the polarising field within the same fragment, whereas 2 can be
  used in more complex situations, e.g. polymers, allowing you to specify a second fragment number
  so that junction atoms does not contribute to either of the neighbouring fragments.
  Finally, the fifth and last integer [nRead] (relevant only if Langevin dipoles are used) may
  be 0 or 1 (where 0 is default), specifying whether an element number (e.g. 8 for oxygen) should be
  read for each multipole. In that case the default radius for that element is used to determine which
  Langevin grid points should be annihilated. A negative element number signifies that a particular
  radius should be used for that multipole, in thousands of a Bohr (-1400 meaning 1.4 Bohr).
  Then follows nXF lines, one for each center. On each line is first nFrag+nRead (which may equal 0)
  integers, specifying the fragments that the multipole should not contribute to (the first fragment is
  taken as the fragment that the polarisability belongs to) and the element number. Then follows
  the three coordinates of the center, followed by the multipoles and polarisabilities. The number of
  multipole entries is 0 for nOrd=-1, 1 for nOrd=0, 4 for nOrd=1, and 10 for nOrd=2. The number of
  polarisability entries are 0 for p=0, 1 for p=1, and 6 for p=2. The order of quadrupole moment and
  anisotropic polarisability entries is xx, xy, xz, yy, yz, zz. If default is used, i.e. only specifying
  the number of centers on the first line, each of these lines will contain 7 entries (coordinates,
  charge, and dipole vector). All entries are in atomic units, if not otherwise requested by the :kword:`Angstrom`

The Saddle method for transition state optimization
...................................................

The Saddle method :cite:`Saddle_method` is a method to locate transition states (TS). The method, in practice, can be viewed as a
series of constrained optimization along the reaction path, which connects two starting structure (could be
the reactants and products of a reaction), to locate the region of the TS and a subsequent unconstrained optimization
to locate the TS. The only data needed for the procedure are the energies and coordinates of the two structures.
**Note** that this option will overwrite the
coordinates which have already been specified with the normal input of the molecular geometry. However, this does
not make that input section redundant and should always be included.

Geometry optimization using constrained internal coordinates
............................................................

.. compound::

  These keyword are used together with the :program:`geo` to optimize the relative position of two or
  more rigid fragments. The starting geometry can either be defined by supplying an xyz-file for each
  fragment using the keyword :kword:`coord` or by placing a file named :file:`$Project.zmt` in a directory
  named :file:`$Project.GEO`. The z-matrix should be in the following format: ::

    O     0.982011 0                                 1
    H     0.982013 0   104.959565 0                  2   1

  where the three columns of real numbers are internal coordinates, and the last
  three columns of integers indicate which other atoms that are used to define
  the coordinate. The type of coordinates from left to right are bond distances,
  bond angles and dihedral angels, both for the coordinates and the link. The
  column of integers just to the right of each coordinate indicate if this
  coordinate should be optimized or not (1 = optimize, 0 = do not optimize).

There are also two utility-keywords used to create a z-matrix or to write out
a constraint-definition for :program:`slapaf` and keywords to rotate and translate
fragments. (See documentation for :program:`GEO` for more details)

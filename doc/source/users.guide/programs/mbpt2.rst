Description
-----------

The :program:`MBPT2` program of the |molcas| program system computes
the second order correlation energy and the reference weight for a
closed-shell Hartree--Fock reference wave function, based on a
MÃ¸ller--Plesset partitioning of the Hamiltonian and canonical orbitals.

If :program:`SEWARD` performed a Cholesky decomposition of the two-electron integrals prior to running
the :program:`MBPT2` program, Cholesky vectors will be employed for computing
the second order energy correction. This is done by first transforming the
Cholesky vectors to MO basis and subsequently computing the :math:`(ai|bj)` integrals.
These integrals are either computed, stored on disk, and then read back in to
memory during the energy evaluation (i.e. mimicking a conventional calculation)
or they may be computed on-the-fly. The user may choose either algorithm
through the Cholesky-specific options described below.

If :program:`SEWARD` did not perform a Cholesky decomposition,
the transformation of the two-electron integrals in AO basis
(:math:`\mathcal{O}(N^4)`, where :math:`N` is the number of basis functions)
to the exchange operator matrices :math:`\mat{K}^{ij}` in MO basis
(:math:`\mathcal{O}(O^2)` matrices of size :math:`V^2`, where :math:`O` and :math:`V` denote the number
of occupied and virtual orbitals, respectively), is either done
conventionally, using the two-electron integral file :file:`ORDINT`, which
was generated in a previous step by the :program:`SEWARD` integral code.

.. _UG\:sec\:mbpt2_dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

The :program:`MBPT2` program requires the communications file :file:`RUNFILE`.
It contains specifications processed by :program:`SEWARD`,
the Hartree--Fock canonical orbitals, eigenvalues and energy generated
by :program:`SCF`.
For Cholesky-based calculations, all Cholesky related files (see the
manual pages for :program:`SEWARD`) must be available, whereas
for conventional (not integral-direct) calculations
the two-electron integral file :file:`ORDINT`
is required. Hence, before running :program:`MBPT2`, a :program:`SEWARD`
and a :program:`SCF` run have to be performed.

:kword:`LOVMp2`
  "Freeze-and-Delete" type of MP2, available only in connection with Cholesky or RI.
  An example of input for the keyword :kword:`LOVM` is the following: ::

    LovMP2
    2  0.2  (nCenters,thrs)
    C1 N    (Center labels)
    DoMP2

  In this case, both occupied and virtual orbitals (localized by the program) are divided in two groups: those (A) mainly located on the
  two (symmetry independent) centers C1 and C2, and the remaining ones (B), which are obviously "outside" this region.
  The value of the threshold (between 0 and 1) is used to perform this selection
  (in the example, 20% of the gross Mulliken population of a given orbital on the specified atoms).
  By default, the MP2 calculation is performed only for the correlating orbitals associated with the region A ("active site").
  The keyword :kword:`DoMP2` is optional and forces the program to perform also an independent MP2 calculation on
  the "frozen region" (B).
  Alternatively, one can specify the keyword :kword:`VirAll` in order to use all virtual orbitals as correlating space for the
  occupied orbitals of the active site.

  The calculation of the density matrix substantially increases

  density matrix will automatically be passed on to that module when this keyword

  .. xmldoc:: </GROUP>

:kword:`NODEcompose`
  Turns off Cholesky decomposition of the :math:`(ai|bj)` integrals.
  Default is to not decompose.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Nodecompose <advanced>
              Turns off Cholesky decomposition of the (ai|bj) integrals.

:kword:`SPAN`
  Specifies the span factor used for :math:`(ai|bj)` Cholesky decomposition.
  Takes as argument one real number.
  Default is the span factor used by :program:`SEWARD` for decomposing the two-electron
  integrals.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Span <advanced>
              Specifies the span factor used for (ai|bj) Cholesky decomposition.

:kword:`MXQUal`
  Specifies the max. number of qualified diagonals treated during :math:`(ai|bj)` Cholesky decomposition.
  Takes as argument one integer.
  Default is 10% of the max. rank of :math:`(ai|bj)`, although never more than 200.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: MxQual <advanced>
              Specifies the max. number of qualified diagonals treated during (ai|bj) Cholesky decomposition.

:kword:`PRESort`
  Presort the MO Cholesky vectors according to the batches over occupied orbitals.
  This will reduce the amount of I/O performed during on-the-fly
  assembly of the :math:`(ai|bj)` integrals.
  This keyword is obsolete.

  .. Default is to sort when more than 2 batches over occupied orbitals are required.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: Presort <advanced>
              Presort the MO Cholesky vectors according to the batches over occupied orbitals.

Limitations
...........

The maximum number of selectively frozen
:kword:`SFRO` or selectively deleted orbitals
:kword:`SDEL` in each symmetry is limited to 50.

The limitations on the number of basis functions are the same as specified
for :program:`SEWARD`.

  Title
   H2O:  O(9.5/4.2), H(4/2)
  * The lowest energy occupied orbital in the repr. no.1 will be frozen in
  * MBPT2 calculations. The number of representations is 4 and all zeros
  * must be explicitly given
  Frozen
  1 0 0 0
  * Two highest energy external orbitals in the repr. no.3 will be deleted
  * in MBPT2 calculations. The number of representations is 4 and all
  * zeros must be explicitly given
  Deleted
  0 0 2 0
  * One occupied orbital in symmetry no.1 will be additionally frozen by
  * using the SFRO option. Let it be the third SCF occupied orbital in
  * this symmetry
  sFrozen
  1 0 0 0   // Gives the number of frozen orbitals in each symmetry
  3         // Gives the frozen orbital reference number in symmetry no. 1
  * Two external orbitals in symmetry no.1 and one external orbital in
  * symmetry 3 will be deleted. In symmetry 1 let it be the second and
  * third external orbitals, and in symmetry 3 the third (already deleted
  * in by using the option DELE) external orbital
  sDeleted
  2 0 1 0   // Gives the number of orbitals to be deleted in each symmetry
  2 3       // Gives the reference numbers of external orbitals in sym. 1
  3         // Gives the reference number of the external orb. in sym. 3

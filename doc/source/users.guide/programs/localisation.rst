            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The LOCALISATION program of the molcas program system generates
            localised occupied orbitals according to one of the following procedures:
            Pipek-Mezey, Boys, Edmiston-Ruedenberg, or Cholesky.
            Orthonormal, linearly independent, local virtual orbitals may also be
            generated from projected atomic orbitals (Cholesky PAOs).
            </HELP>

The :program:`LOCALISATION` program of the |molcas| program system generates
localised occupied orbitals according to one of the following procedures:
Pipek--Mezey :cite:`Pipek:89`,
Boys :cite:`Boys:60,Foster:60`,
Edmiston--Ruedenberg :cite:`Edmiston:63`, or
Cholesky :cite:`Aquilante:06a`.
Orthonormal, linearly independent, local orbitals may also be
generated from projected atomic orbitals (Cholesky PAOs) :cite:`Aquilante:06a`.

.. compound::

  Orbital localisation makes use of the fact that a Hartree-Fock wave function
  is invariant under unitary transformations of the occupied orbitals,

  .. math:: \tilde{C}_{\mu i} = \sum_j C_{\mu j} \mat{U}_{ji} ,

  where :math:`\mat{U}` is unitary (i.e. orthogonal for real orbitals).
  The same is true for the inactive or active orbitals in a CASSCF wave function.
  Whereas the Pipek--Mezey :cite:`Pipek:89`,
  Boys :cite:`Boys:60,Foster:60`, and
  Edmiston--Ruedenberg :cite:`Edmiston:63` procedures define :math:`\mat{U}`
  through an iterative maximization of a localisation functional,
  the Cholesky orbitals are simply defined through the Cholesky decomposition
  of the one-electron density, i.e.

  .. math:: \sum_i \tilde{C}_{\mu i}\tilde{C}_{\nu i} = P_{\mu\nu} = \sum_i C_{\mu i} C_{\mu i} .

  Cholesky orbitals are thus not optimum localised orbitals by any of the
  Pipek--Mezey, Boys, or Edmiston--Ruedenberg measures, but rather inherit locality
  from the density matrix, see :cite:`Aquilante:06a` for details.

Although these localisation schemes are mostly meant for localising occupied
orbitals (except for PAOs which are defined for the virtual orbitals), the
:program:`LOCALISATION` program will attempt to localise any set of orbitals
that the user specifies. This means that it is possible to mix
occupied and virtual orbitals and thereby break the Hartree--Fock
invariance. The default settings, however, do not break the invariance.

For Pipek--Mezey, Boys, and Edmiston--Ruedenberg localisations, iterative
optimizations are carried out. We use
the :math:`\eta`-steps of Subotnik *et al.* :cite:`Subotnik:04` for
Edmiston--Ruedenberg, whereas the traditional Jacobi sweeps (consecutive
two-by-two orbital rotations) :cite:`Pipek:89,Subotnik:04`
are employed for the Pipek--Mezey and Boys schemes.

.. _UG\:sec\:localisation_dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

The :program:`LOCALISATION` program requires the one-electron integral file
:file:`ONEINT` and the communications file :file:`RUNFILE`,
which contains, among other data, the
basis set specifications processed by :program:`GATEWAY` and :program:`SEWARD`.
In addition, the Edmiston--Ruedenberg procedure requires the presence
of Cholesky decomposed two-electron integrals produced by :program:`SEWARD`.

  and the threshold used to select the localised orbitals belonging to this region
  (recommended values > 0.2 and < 1).
  An additional line gives the names of the (symmetry unique) atoms as defined in the :program:`SEWARD` input.
  The keyword :kword:`LOCN` is used to define suitable occupation numbers for RASSCF active orbitals
  that have been localised. It has proven useful in Effective Bond Order (EBO) analysis.
  Here is a sample input for a complex containing an iron-iron multiple bond. ::

    LOCN
    2  0.3
    Fe1  Fe2

  In this example, the (localised) orbitals constructed by the :program:`LOCALISATION` program
  are subdivided in two groups: those having less than 0.3 total Mulliken population on
  the two iron atoms, and the remaining orbitals, obviously localised on the iron-iron region. The resulting
  density matrices for the two subsets of orbitals are then diagonalized separately
  and the corresponding (localised) natural orbitals written to :file:`LOCORB` with the proper occupation
  numbers. Note that the two sets of LNOs are mutually non-orthogonal.

              %%Keyword: LOCN <basic>
              This keyword is used to select atoms for defining the localised natural
              orbitals (LNOs), thus a set of localised orbitals with well-defined occupation numbers.
              All other options specified in the localisation input apply (e.g., input orbitals,
              localisation method, etc.).
              On the next line give the number of (symmetry unique) atoms that identify the region of interest
              and the threshold used to select the localised orbitals belonging to this region.
              An additional line gives the names of the atoms as defined in the SEWARD input.
              This keyword is used to define occupation numbers when localising active orbitals
              from RASSCF calculations. Particularly useful in Effective Bond Order (EBO) analysis.

:kword:`LOCCanonical orbitals`
  This keyword is used to select atoms for defining the localised canonical
  orbitals (LCOs), thus a set of localised orbitals with well-defined orbital energies
  (eigenvalues of a local Fock matrix).
  Please, refer to the analogous keyword :kword:`LOCN` in this manual for more details and input examples.

Limitations
...........

The limitations on the number of basis functions are the same as specified
for :program:`SEWARD`.

Input examples
..............

This input is an example of the Boys localisation of the CO molecule. Note that no
symmetry should not be used in any calculation of localised orbitals except for
Cholesky and PAO orbitals.

.. extractfile:: ug/localisation.Boys.input

  &GATEWAY
  Coord = $MOLCAS/Coord/CO.xyz
  Basis = STO-3G
  Group = C1

  &SEWARD ; &SCF

  &LOCALISATION
  Boys

This input is an example of the Projected Atomic Orbital localisation of the
virtual orbitals of the CO molecule. The threshold for the Cholesky
decomposition that removes linear dependence is set to 1.0d-14.

.. extractfile:: ug/localisation.PAO.input

  &GATEWAY
  Coord = $MOLCAS/Coord/CO.xyz
  Basis = STO-3G
  Group = C1

  &SEWARD ; &SCF

  &LOCALISATION
  PAO
  Threshold = 1.0d-14

This input is an example of the Cholesky localisation (using default 1.0d-8 as
threshold for the decomposition) of the
valence occupied orbitals of the CO molecule.
Orbital domains are set up and analyzed.

            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The CHCC is a Closed-Shell Coupled-Clusters Singles and Doubles program
            based exclusively on the Cholesky (or RI) decomposed 2-electron integrals aimed
            towards calculation of large system. Use of point-group symmetry is not
            implemented.
            It requires RUNFILE from the SCF module and Cholesky vectors from SEWARD.
            </HELP>

The :program:`CHCC` is a Closed-Shell Coupled-Clusters Singles and Doubles
program based exclusively on the Cholesky (or RI) decomposed 2-electron integrals
aimed towards calculation of large systems on highly parallel architectures. Use of
point-group symmetry is not implemented. Main advantage compared to the
:program:`CCSDT` module in |molcas| is in its more efficient parallelization and
dramatically lowered memory (and eventually disk) requirements.

.. For further details the reader is referred to the section :ref:`TUT:sec:chcc`.

Dependencies
------------

:program:`CHCC` requires a previous run of the RHF :program:`SCF` program
to produce molecular orbitals and orbital energies stored in :file:`RUNFILE`.
The :program:`SCF` program (as well as :program:`SEWARD`) must be run
in Cholesky/RI mode.

The algorithm used for almost complete elimination of the :program:`CHCC`
limits in calculated system size due to the computer memory bottleneck relies
on blocking of the virtual orbitals. Number of blocks (further also referred to as the
"large" segmentation, :kword:`LARGe`), :math:`N'`, should be as small as
possible, because increasing of the segmentation brings in more CPU and I/O overhead.
Furthermore, blocking can be "fine tuned" by, so called, "small" segmentation (:kword:`SMALl`), :math:`N''`,
which affects only the (typically) most demanding :math:`O^2V^4` scaling
terms. The "large" segmentation can range from 1 to 32, "small" segmentation from 1 to 8, but
their product, i.e. "large" |x| "small" must be no more than 64.

Selected blocking also determines the
number of "independent" parallel tasks that must be executed in each iteration of
the CCSD equations. In other words, particular segmentation predetermines the optimal
number of computational nodes (i.e., if the best possible parallelization is desired).
If the requested "large" segmentation is :math:`N'`, then :math:`N'^2` terms scaling as
:math:`O^3V^3` and :math:`N'^2/2` terms scaling as :math:`O^2V^4` result.
Depending on which of these terms dominated in the calculations (:math:`O^3V^3`
is more demanding for systems with large number of occupied orbitals and rather small
basis set, while :math:`O^2V^4` dominated for relatively large basis sets,
i.e. large number of virtual orbitals), number of these task should be divisible by the number of
computational nodes for optimal performance. To make it simple, as a rule of thumb, :math:`N'^2/2`
should be divisible by the number of nodes, since the :math:`O^3V^3` are typically twice less
expensive then the :math:`O^2V^4` step. Otherwise, any reasonable (i.e. the number
of tasks is larger than the number of computational nodes, obviously) combination is allowed.

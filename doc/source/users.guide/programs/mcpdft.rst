            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            The MCPDFT program performs an MC-PDFT calculation following a
            CASSCF, RASSCF, or GASSCF wave function run. It requires the
            one- and two-electron integral files generated by SEWARD, and
            a JOBIPH file generated by the RASSCF module.
            </HELP>

The :program:`MCPDFT` program in |molcas| performs multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) calculations,
as described in :cite:`limanni2014,limanni2015`. The MC-PDFT method involves two steps:
(i) a CASSCF, RASSCF, or GASSCF wave function calculation to obtain the kinetic energy, classical Coulomb energy,
total electron density, and on-top pair density; (ii) a post-SCF calculation of the remaining energy using an on-top density functional.
In the current implementation, the on-top pair density functional is obtained by "translation" (t) of exchange-correlation functionals.
Four translated functionals are currently available: tLSDA, tPBE, tBLYP, and trevPBE, in addition to the "fully-translated" (ft)
variants :cite:`Carlson2015`: ftLSDA, ftPBE, ftBLYP, and ftrevPBE.
As multiconfigurational wave functions are used as input quantities, spin and space symmetry are correctly conserved.

The molecular orbitals and one- and two-body density matrices are read from the :file:`JOBIPH` (or :file:`JOBOLD`) file
generated during a :program:`RASSCF` run.

Dependencies
------------

.. compound::

  To start the :program:`MCPDFT` module, the one-electron
  and two-electron integrals generated by :program:`SEWARD` are required. For MC-PDFT calculations it is suggested to use a fine or ultrafine
  grid via the following input specifications (see the :program:`SEWARD` section for further details): ::

    &SEWARD
    grid input
    grid=ultrafine
    end of grid input

  Additionally, a :file:`JOBIPH` file must be supplied to provide the molecular orbitals and one- and two-body density matrices.

Input files
...........

:program:`MCPDFT` will use the following input
files: :file:`ONEINT`, :file:`ORDINT`, :file:`RUNFILE`, :file:`JOBOLD`,
:file:`JOBIPH`.

If Cholesky options are selected, additional Cholesky-related files will also be used.
Only :file:`JOBIPH` or :file:`JOBOLD` is needed; the code will first look for :file:`JOBOLD`
first and :file:`JOBIPH` second.

Output files

.. class:: filelist

:file:`JOBPDFT`
  This file is written in binary format and has the same structue of the :file:`JOBIPH` file.

:file:`RUNFILE`
  The :file:`RUNFILE` is updated with information from the MC-PDFT calculation.

:file:`MCDENS`
  This ASCII file is generated for MC-PDFT calculations.
  It contains spin densities, total density and on-top pair density values on grid (coordinates in a.u.).

Input example
.............

The following example shows the input to the
:program:`RASSCF` and :program:`MCPDFT` programs for a calculation on the water molecule.
The tPBE functional is used. The calculation is
performed in |Ctv| symmetry (symmetries: |ao|, |bt|, |bo|, |at|, where the two
last species are antisymmetric with respect to the molecular plane). Inactive
orbitals are 1\ |ao| (oxygen 1\ |s|) 2\ |ao| (oxygen 2\ |s|) and
1\ |bo| (the :math:`\pi` lone-pair orbital). Two bonding and two anti-bonding
:math:`\ce{OH}` orbitals are active, |ao| and |bt| symmetries. The calculation is
performed for the |SAO| ground state. Note that no information about basis set,
geometry, etc has to be given. Such information is supplied by the
:program:`SEWARD` integral program via the one-electron integral file :file:`ONEINT`.

::

  &RASSCF
  Title= Water molecule. Active orbitals OH and OH* in both symmetries
  Spin     = 1
  Symmetry = 1
  Inactive = 2 0 1 0
  Ras2     = 2 2 0 0

  &MCPDFT
  KSDFT=TPBE

The first RASSCF run is a standard CASSCF calculation that leads to variationally optimized orbitals and CI coefficients.
The MC-PDFT run will use the orbitals and density matrices optimized during the preceding RASSCF run.

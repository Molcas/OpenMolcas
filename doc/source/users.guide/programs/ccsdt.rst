            <HELP>
            The CCSDT set of programs performs the iterative ROHF CCSD
            procedure, optionally followed by the (T) calculation contribution.
            It requires the JOBIPH file produced by RASSCF, and TRAONE and TRAINT
            files produced by MOTRA.
            </HELP>

:program:`CCSDT` performs the iterative single determinant CCSD procedure for
open shell systems and the noniterative triple contribution calculation to
the CCSD energy.
For further details the reader is referred to
:numref:`Sections %s <TUT:sec:ccsdt>` and
:numref:`%s <TUT:sec:rp_wf>` of the tutorials and examples manual.

Dependencies
------------

:program:`CCSDT` requires a previous run of the :program:`RASSCF` program
to produce orbital energies, Fock matrix elements, wave function
specification, and some other parameters stored in file :file:`JOBIPH`.
The :program:`RASSCF` program should be run with the options that produce
canonical output orbitals, which is not default.
:program:`CCSDT` also requires transformed integrals produced by :program:`MOTRA`
and stored in the files :file:`TRAONE` and :file:`TRAINT`.

It is well known that the CCSD procedure brings the spin
contamination into the final
wave function :math:`\ket{\Psi}` even in the case where the reference function
:math:`\ket{\Phi}` is the proper
spin eigenfunction. The way how to reduce the spin
contamination and mainly the number of independent amplitudes is to introduce
the spin adaptation.
Besides the standard nonadapted (spinorbital) CCSD procedure this program
allows to use different levels of spin
adaptation of CCSD amplitudes (the recommended citations are Refs.
:cite:`ccsd_neo2,ccsd_neo1`):

* DDVV T2 adaptation.

  This is the most simple and most universal scheme, in which only the dominant
  part of T2 amplitudes, namely those where both electrons are excited from
  *doubly occupied (inactive)* to *virtual (secondary)* orbitals, are adapted.
  The remaining types of amplitudes are left unadapted, i.e. in the spinorbital form.
  This alternative is an excellent approximation to the full adaptation and
  can be used for any multiplet.

* Full T1 and T2 adaptation (only for doublet states yet).

  In this case full spin adaptation of all types of amplitudes is performed.
  In the present implementation this version is limited to systems with
  the single unpaired electrons, i.e. to the doublet states only.

Besides these two possibilities there are also available some
additional partial ones (see keyword
:kword:`ADAPTATION` in :numref:`sec:ccsdt_input`). These adaptations are
suitable only for some specific purposes. More details on spin adaptation in
the CCSD step can be found in Refs. :cite:`ccsd_neo1,ccsd_neo2,ccsd_kno`.
The current implementation of the spin adaptation saves no computer time. A more
efficient version is under development.

The noniterative triples calculation can follow these approaches:

* CCSD + T(CCSD) --- according to Urban et al. :cite:`t3_urban`
* CCSD(T) --- according to Raghavachari et al. :cite:`t3_ragh`
* CCSD(T) --- according e.g. to Watts et al. :cite:`t3_watts`

Actual implementation and careful analysis and discussion of these
methods is described in Ref. :cite:`t3_neo`, which is a recommended reference
for this program.

The first alternative represents the simplest noniterative T3 treatment and contains
only pure :math:`\braket{T3}{W T2}` term. Second possibility represents the well known
extension to the first one by the :math:`\braket{T3}{W T1}` term
(:math:`W` is the two electron perturbation). For closed shell
systems this is the most popular and most frequently used noniterative triples
method. For single determinant open shell systems, described by the
ROHF reference
function standard (Raghavachari et. al.) method needs to be extended by the
additional fourth order energy term, namely
:math:`\braket{T3}{U T2}` (:math:`U` is the off-diagonal part of the Fock operator).

In contrast to the iterative CCSD procedure, noniterative approaches are not
invariant with respect to the partitioning of the Hamiltonian.
Hence, we obtain
different results using orbital energies, Fock matrix elements
or some other quantities in the
denominator. According to our experiences :cite:`t3_neo`,
diagonal Fock matrix elements in the
denominator represent the best choice. Using of other alternatives
requires some experience.
Since the triple excitation contribution procedure works strictly within the restricted formalism, resulting
noniterative triples contributions depend also on the choice of the reference
function. However, differences between this approach (with the reference
function produced by a single determinant RASSCF procedure and the diagonal
Fock matrix elements considered in the denominator) and the corresponding
invariant treatment (with the semicanonical orbitals)
are found to be chemically negligible.

For noniterative T3 contribution both non-adapted (spin-orbital) and spin-adapted
CCSD amplitudes can be used. For more details, see Ref. :cite:`t3_neo`.

              This keyword sets the preferred type of matrix multiplication.
              On the following line n, limit must be specified:

              n=1 -- standard matrix multiplication is performed
              n=2 -- A(T)*B matrix multiplication is performed, if
                     size(A)/size(B) is less than limit. See manual!

How to run closed shell calculations using ROHF CC codes
--------------------------------------------------------

First of all it should be noted here, that it is not advantageous
to run closed shell calculations using ROHF CC codes, since
in the present implementation it will require the same number of
arithmetical operations and the core and disk space like corresponding
open shell calculations.

Since ROHF CC codes are connected to the output of :program:`RASSCF` code (through the
:file:`JOBIPH` file), it is necessary to run closed shell Hartree--Fock using
the :program:`RASSCF` program. This can be done by setting the number of active orbitals
and electrons to zero (also by including only doubly occupied orbitals into the
active space; this has no advantage but increases the computational effort).
to guarantee the single reference character of the wave function.

The CC program will recognize the closed shell case automatically and will reorganize
all integrals in a required form.
For more information the reader is referred to the tutorials and examples manual.

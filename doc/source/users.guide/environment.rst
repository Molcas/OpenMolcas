Commands and environment variables
==================================

This section will describe the usage of |molcas| in an
UNIX environment.

Production jobs using |molcas| in an UNIX environment can be
performed as batch jobs.
This requires the creation of a shell script that
contains a few simple commands. Further you need to create input for
each program module that you intend to use. This section describes the
necessary steps you have to take in order to make a successful job using
|molcas|.
Input examples for a typical |molcas|
run can be found in :file:`doc/samples/problem_based_tutorials/` directory.
Also you can use some input examples
in :file:`Test/input` subdirectory.

Commands
--------

There is a command supplied with the |molcas| package, named
:command:`molcas`, that the user issue to perform a given task.
A sequence of such commands will perform the calculation requested by
the user.

.. class:: commandlist

:command:`molcas`
  This command tells which |molcas| installation will be used, and gives
  some help about usage of |molcas| command

:command:`molcas` :file:`input-file`
  This command executes a command in the |molcas| system.

:command:`molcas help` :program:`prgm`
  This command gives the list of available keywords for program :program:`prgm`.

:command:`molcas help` :program:`prgm keyword`
  This command gives description of a :program:`keyword`.

:command:`molcas help` :program:`environment`
  This command gives a list of |molcas| specific environment variables.

:command:`molcas help` :program:`basis element`
  This command gives a list of basis sets available for an :program:`element`.

The following is an example of running |molcas| by using a single input file: ::

  molcas $Project.input

An alternative way of running |molcas| as a sequence of separate calls: ::

  molcas $Project.seward.input    # Execute seward
  molcas $Project.scf.input       # Execute scf

By default, the output will go directly to the screen. It can be redirected
by using flag :command:`-f`, e.g. :command:`molcas -f water.inp` will store the output
in :file:`water.log` and :file:`water.err` files.

The default behavior of |molcas| execution can be altered by setting environment variables.

Project name and working directory
----------------------------------

When running a project, |molcas| uses the variable
:variable:`Project` giving a project name, and a scratch directory defined by
the variable :variable:`WorkDir`.
This serves the purpose of maintaining structure of the files and
facilitating automatic file mapping.

There are several ways to set up these variables.
By default, the name of the Project constructed from the name of the input file,
by removing the last suffix, e.g. for example for an input name :file:`Water.SCF.input`
the :variable:`Project` name will be :variable:`Water.SCF`.
Alternatively,
user can set environment variable :variable:`Project`, or :variable:`MOLCAS_PROJECT`.

Scratch directory can be set by environment variable :variable:`MOLCAS_WORKDIR`.
If it is set to value ``PWD``, current directory will be used. Otherwise,
it can be set to a directory name. In this case scratch area will be located
in a subdirectory :file:`$MOLCAS_WORKDIR/$Project`. It is also possible to
overwrite the value of scratch area, by setting environment variable
:variable:`WorkDir`.

* :command:`Project=...; export Project`
* :command:`WorkDir=...; export WorkDir`

|molcas| modules communicates between each other via files, located in the :variable:`WorkDir`.
The description of internal filenames and file mapping can be found at Appendix.

Input
-----

.. compound::

  When you have decided which program modules you need to use to perform your
  calculation, you need to construct input for each of these. There is no
  particular structure enforced on the input files, but it is recommended that
  you follow:

  * :file:`$Project.<prgm-name>.input`

  which is the name of the input files assumed in the sample shell script.

Preparing a job
---------------

When you prepare a job for batch processing, you have to create a shell script.
It is recommended that you use the sample shell script supplied with
|molcas| as a starting point when building your own shell script.
The following steps are taken in the shell script:

#. Define and export the |molcas| variables

   * Project (or use :variable:`MOLCAS_PROJECT`)
   * WorkDir (or :variable:`MOLCAS_WORKDIR`)

#. Issue a sequence of |molcas| commands.
#. Remove the scratch directory and all files in it.

The following is an example of a shell script. ::

  Project=HF; export Project                               # Define the project id
  WorkDir=/temp/$LOGNAME/$Project.$RANDOM; export WorkDir  # Define scratch directory
  molcas $Project.input                                    # Run molcas with input file, which
                                                           # contains inputs for several modules
  rm -r $WorkDir                                           # Clean up

The file :file:`$ThisDir/$Project.input` contains the ordered sequence
of |molcas| inputs and the EMIL interpreter will call the appropriate
programs. See section :ref:`UG:sec:EMIL` for an explanation of the
additional tools available in the EMIL interpreter.

The following is an example of a shell script to be submitted for batch
execution. ::

  Project=HF; export Project                               # Define the project id
  WorkDir=/temp/$LOGNAME/$Project.$RANDOM; export WorkDir  # Define scratch directory
  molcas $Project.seward.input                             # Execute seward
  molcas $Project.scf.input                                # Execute scf
  rm -r $WorkDir                                           # Clean up

An alternative way to control the usage of the WorkDir is to use flags in molcas command:

.. class:: commandlist

:command:`-new`
  clean WorkDir before the usage

:command:`-clean`
  clean WorkDir after the usage

Note, that if you configured your working environment by using :command:`setuprc` script,
the only command you have to place into the shell script is: ::

  molcas $Project.input

.. _UG\:sec\:sysvar:

System variables
----------------

|molcas| contains a set of system variables that the user can
set to modify the default behaviour of |molcas|. Two of them
(Project and WorkDir) must be set in order to make |molcas| work at all.
There are defaults for these but you are advised not to use the defaults.

There are several ways of using |molcas| environment variables:

* These variables can be exported in your shell script ::

    export MOLCAS_MEM=512
    molcas input

* These variables can be included into |molcas| input: ::

    * begin of the input file
    >>> export MOLCAS_MEM=512

      . . .

* variables can be included directly into :command:`molcas` command in the form: ::

    molcas MOLCAS_MEM=512 input

The simplest way to set up default environment for |molcas| is
to use script :file:`setuprc`, which can be run as command
:command:`molcas setuprc`. This interactive script creates
a resource file :file:`molcasrc`, located either in :file:`$MOLCAS` or :file:`$HOME/.Molcas`
directory. The priority of these settings is: user defined settings
(e.g. in :command:`molcas` command), user resource file, |molcas| resource file.

Two flags in |molcas| command are related to resource files:

.. class:: variablelist

:variable:`-env`
  Display current |molcas| environment
  e.g. :command:`molcas -env input` will print information about environment
  variables, used during execution of the input file.

:variable:`-ign`
  Ignore resource files
  e.g. :command:`molcas -ign input` will process input file without settings,
  which are stored in :file:`$MOLCAS/molcasrc` and in :file:`$HOME/molcasrc` files.

User can customize his installation by adding MOLCAS environment variable into :file:`molcasrc` file.

Another way of customizing |molcas| is to use prologue and epilogue scripts. If user created a file
:file:`prologue` in :file:`$HOME/.Molcas` directory it will be executed (as :command:`./prologue`) before |molcas| calculation
starts. :file:`epilogue` in :file:`$HOME/.Molcas` directory will be executed at the end of calculation.
Files :file:`module.prologue` and :file:`module.epilogue` contains commands executing before and after
each executable molcas module. These files may use internal |molcas| variables, such as
:variable:`$Project`, :variable:`$WorkDir`, :variable:`$MOLCAS_MEM`, etc. Note that prologue/epilogue scripts should be executable.
For debug purposes, the location of prologue and epilogue files can be set by :variable:`$MOLCAS_LOGUE_DIR` variable.

Example:

:file:`prologue`: ::

  echo Calculation of $Project input will start at `date`

:file:`module.prologue`: ::

  echo Running module $MOLCAS_CURRENT_PROGRAM at $WorkDir
